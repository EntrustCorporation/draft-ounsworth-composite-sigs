<p>The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor the new incoming algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the required data lifetimes. The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptanalysis, while the incoming post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying mathematics as well as hardware and software implementations that have not had sufficient maturing time to rule out classical cryptanalytic attacks and implementation bugs.</p>
<p>Cautious implementer may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such that an attacker would need to break all of them in order to compromise the data being protected. For digital signatures, this is referred to as "dual", and for encryption key establishment this as referred to as "hybrid". This document, and its companions, defines a specific instantiation of the dual and hybrid paradigm called "composite" where multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined to form a single key, signature, or key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) such that they can be treated as a single atomic object at the protocol level.</p>
<p>EDNOTE: the terms "dual" and "hybrid" are currently in flux. We anticipate an Informational draft to normalize terminology, and will update this draft accordingly.</p>
<p>This document defines the structures CompositeSignatureValue, and CompositeParams, which are sequences of the respective structure for each component algorithm. The generic composite variant is defined which allows arbitrary combinations of signature algorithms to be used in the CompositeSignatureValue and CompositeParams structures without needing the combination to be pre-registered or pre-agreed. The explicit variant is also defined which allows for a set of signature algorithm identifier OIDs to be registered together as an explicit composite signature algorithm and assigned an OID.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had sufficient scrutiny and time to discover and fix implementation bugs. Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm migrations, the choice of when to migrate and which algorithms to migrate to, is not so clear. Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to be composed of multiple public-key algorithms.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">The deployment of composite signatures using post-quantum algorithms will face two challenges</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy, but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary has compromised.</li>
<li>Backwards compatibility: During the transition period, post-quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.3">These migration and interoperability concerns need to be thought about in the context of various types of protocols that make use of X.509 and PKIX with relation to digital signature objects, from online negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and IKEv2 [RFC7296], to non-negotiated asynchronous protocols such as S&#8288;/&#8288;MIME signed email [RFC8551], document signing such as in the context of the European eIDAS regulations [eIDAS2014], and publicly trusted code signing [codeSigningBRsv2.8], as well as myriad other standardized and proprietary protocols and applications that leverage CMS <a href="#RFC5652" class="xref">[RFC5652]</a> signed structures.</p>

<p><a href="#sec-comp-sig-gen" class="xref">Section 5.1</a> and <a href="#sec-comp-sig-verify" class="xref">Section 5.2</a> make reference to subset signature generation and verification modes to achieve an OR relation between component signatures, where senders and / or receivers are permitted to ignore some component keys. Some envisioned uses of this include environments where the client encounters a component signature algorithm for which it does not posses a compatible implementation but wishes to proceed with the signature verification using the subset of component signatures for which it does have compatible implementations. Such a mechanism could be designed to provide ease of migration by allowing for composite keys to be distributed and used before all clients in the environment are fully upgraded, but it does not allow for full backwards compatibility since clients would at least need to be upgraded from their current state to be able to parse the composite structures.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.1.2.p.1">We present the term "Parallel PKI" to refer to the setup where a PKI end entity possesses two or more distinct public keys or certificates for the same identity (name), but containing keys for different cryptographic algorithms. One could imagine a set of parallel PKIs where an existing PKI using legacy algorithms (RSA, ECC) is left operational during the post-quantum migration but is shadowed by one or more parallel PKIs using pure post quantum algorithms or composite algorithms (legacy and post-quantum).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.2.p.2">Equipped with a set of parallel public keys in this way, a client would have the flexibility to choose which public key(s) or certificate(s) to use in a given signature operation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.2.p.3">For negotiated protocols, the client could choose which public key(s) or certificate(s) to use based on the negotiated algorithms, or could combine two of the public keys for example in a non-composite hybrid method such as <a href="#I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth" class="xref">[I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth]</a> or <a href="#I-D.guthrie-ipsecme-ikev2-hybrid-auth" class="xref">[I-D.guthrie-ipsecme-ikev2-hybrid-auth]</a>. Note that it is possible to use the signature algorithms defined in <a href="#sec-alg-idents" class="xref">Section 4</a> as a way to carry the multiple signature values generated by one of the non-composite public mechanism in protocols where it is easier to support the composite signature algorithms than to implement such a mechanism in the protocol itself. There is also nothing precluding a composite public key from being one of the components used within a non-composite authentication operation; this may lead to greater convenience in setting up parallel PKI hierarchies that need to service a range of clients implementing different styles of post-quantum migration strategies.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.2.p.4">For non-negotiated protocols, the details for obtaining backwards compatibility will vary by protocol, but for example in CMS <a href="#RFC5652" class="xref">[RFC5652]</a>, the inclusion of multiple SignerInfo objects is often already treated as an OR relationship, so including one for each of the signer's parallel PKI public keys would, in many cases, have the desired effect of allowing the receiver to choose one they are compatible with and ignore the others, thus achieving full backwards compatibility.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.10.2.1.p.2">The authors recognize that there may be cases where a client may wish to generate a composite signature that only uses a subset of the available component algorithms, for example to save bandwidth, or because a client has been issued a key for which it does not (yet) have implementations of all component algorithms.

However, this mode was intentionally omitted from this specification as it trivially allows for stripping attacks where an attacker replaces a valid component signature value with NULL, thus reducing the security of the composite signature to the weakest of the available component algorithms.</p>

<pre>
Sign(sk,M):
10: mu \in {0, 1}^384 := CRH(tr || M)

This provides strong security against pre-computed collision attacks since an attacker has no a-priori knowledge of <samp>r</samp> and provides per-signature hash-domain separation of the message to be signed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.8">If the message to be signed is pre-hashed, for example <samp>m0 = SHA256(m)</samp> and then m0 provided to Dilithium or Falcon to sign, then you have re-introduced the collision problem since two messages m1 and m2 where SHA256(m1) == SHA256(m2) will result in a single Falcon or Dilithium signature value which is simultaneously valid for both m1 and m2. This removes the extra collision resistance built in to the Dilithium and Falcon primitives and reduces it to the collision resistance strength of the underlying hash function. For this reason it is in general not recommended to pre-hash when using Dilithium or Falcon except in cases where the implementor is comfortable with this reduction in security.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.3.p.9">Therefore, for the purpose of interoperability of composite signatures, signature alogrithms defined in this version of this document do not pre-hash messages for Dilithium and Falcon. If pre-hashed versions of these signatures are also desired, then separate signature algorithms will need to be defined.</p>

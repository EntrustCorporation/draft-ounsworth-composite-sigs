              Composite Signatures For Use In Internet PKI
                  draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs-07

Abstract

   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
   the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different
   cryptographic algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual
   post-quantum algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic
   operation will need to be performed in such a way that breaking it
   requires breaking each of the component algorithms individually.
   This requires defining new structures for holding composite signature
   data.  This document defines a structure generic enough to be useful
   beyond the post-quantum transition for any situation where a widely-
   supported but untrusted algorithm is being migrated to newer
   cryptography.

   This document defines the structures CompositeSignatureValue, and
   CompositeParams, which are sequences of the respective structure for
   each component algorithm and allows for both explicitely-defined
   combinations of algorithms as well generic runtime-flexible signature
   algorithms.  This document also defines processes for generating and
   verifying composite signatures.  This document makes no assumptions
   about what the component algorithms are, provided that their
   algorithm identifiers and signature generation and verification
   processes are defined.

1.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not
   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had
   sufficient scrutiny and time to discover and fix implementation bugs.
   Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm migrations, the choice of
   when to migrate and which algorithms to migrate to, is not so clear.
   Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an
   entity's cryptographic identity to be composed of multiple public-key
   algorithms.

   The deployment of composite signatures using post-quantum algorithms
   will face two challenges

   o  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   o  Backwards compatibility: During the transition period, post-
      quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.

   This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength
   uncertainty concerns by building on [draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-
   keys-00] (NOTE: need kramdown formatting help with this ref) by
   providing formats for encoding multiple signature values into
   existing public signature fields, as well as the process for
   validating a composite signature.  Backwards compatibility is
   addressed via using composite in conjunction with a non-composite
   hybrid mode such as that described in [draft-becker-guthrie-

   noncomposite-hybrid-auth-00] (NOTE: need kramdown formatting help
   with this ref).

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that
   digital signatures are used within PKIX and CMS structures.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   ALGORITHM: An information object class for identifying the type of
   cryptographic operation to be performed.  This document is primarily
   concerned with algorithms for producing digital signatures.

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   CLIENT: Any software that is making use of a key at runtime.  This
   includes a signer, verifier, encryptor, decryptor.

   COMPONENT ALGORITHM: A single basic algorithm which is contained
   within a composite algorithm.

   COMPOSITE ALGORITHM: An algorithm which is a sequence of two or more
   component algorithms, as defined in Section 2.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   LEGACY: For the purposes of this document, a legacy key or signature
   is a non-composite key or signature.

   PKI: Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in [RFC5280].

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

   SIGNATURE: A digital cryptographic signature, making no assumptions
   about which algorithm.

   STRIPPING ATTACK: An attack in which the attacker is able to
   downgrade the cryptographic object to an attacker-chosen subset of
   original set of component algorithms in such a way that it is not

   detectable by the receiver.  For example, substituting a composite
   public key or signature for a version with fewer components.

1.2.  Changes in version -07

   o  Merged Generic Composite (Section 3.1) and Explicit Composite
      (Section 3.2) into one document and made them share a wire
      encoding (only differing by the OIDs used).

   o  Removed Composite-OR signature mode.

   o  Added Section 5.1 addressing backwards compatibility and ease of
      migration concerns.

   o  Added CompositeParams := Alg1, Alg2, .. Algn as an input parameter
      to the sig gen and verification processes.

   TODO diff this against the public version and see if there are any
   more changes.

2.  Composite Signature Structures

   In order for signatures to be composed of multiple algorithms, we
   define encodings consisting of a sequence of signature primitives
   (aka "component algorithms") such that these structures can be used
   as a drop-in replacement for existing signature fields such as those
   found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS
   [RFC5652].

2.1.  Composite Keys

   A Composite signature MUST be associated with a Composite public key
   as defined in draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys-00] (NOTE: need
   kramdown formatting help with this ref).

2.1.1.  Key Usage Bits

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, then the composite public key associated with a
   composite signature MUST have a signing-type key usage.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a Certification Authority
   (CA) certificate that indicates id-composite-key, then any
   combination of the following values MAY be present:







Ounsworth & Pala        Expires December 2, 2022                [Page 5]

   digitalSignature;
   nonRepudiation;
   keyCertSign; and
   cRLSign.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an End Entity (EE)
   certificate that indicates id-composite-key, then any combination of
   the following values MAY be present:

   digitalSignature; and
   nonRepudiation;

2.2.  sa-CompositeSignature

   The ASN.1 algorithm object for a composite signature is:

   sa-CompositeSignature SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM ::= {
       IDENTIFIER identifier
       VALUE CompositeSignatureValue
       PARAMS ANY DEFINED BY ALGORITHM
       PUBLIC-KEYS { pk-Composite }
       SMIME-CAPS { IDENTIFIED BY id-alg-composite } }
   }

   The identifier specifies the type of composite signature and the
   component algorithms.  This document defines a generic composite
   algorithm, identified by id-alg-composite, in Section 3.1, and allows
   for other standards that will define explicit algorithms that specify
   which component algorithms are to be contained within them.

2.3.  CompositeSignatureValue

   The output of the composite signature algorithm is the DER encoding
   of the following structure:

   CompositeSignatureValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF BIT STRING

   Where each BIT STRING within the SEQUENCE is a signature value
   produced by one of the component keys.  It MUST contain one signature
   value produced by each component algorithm, and in the same order as
   in the associated CompositeParams object.

   A CompositeSignatureValue MUST contain the same number of component
   signatures as the corresponding public and private keys, and the
   order of component signature values MUST correspond to the component
   public keys.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs                   May 2022


   The choice of "SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING", rather than for example a
   single BIT STRING containing the concatenated signature values, is to
   gracefully handle variable-length signature values by taking
   advantage of ASN.1's built-in length fields.

2.4.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that composite signature
   data structures be represented by an octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

   In the interests of simplicity and avoiding compatibility issues,
   implementations that parse these structures MAY accept both BER and
   DER.

3.  Algorithm Identifiers

   Some use-cases desire the flexibility of choosing any combination of
   supported algorithms at runtime, while others desire the rigidity of
   explicitely-specified combinations of algorithms.

3.1.  id-alg-composite

   The id-alg-composite object identifier is used for identifying a
   generic composite signature.  This algorithm allows for runtime
   agents to use arbitrary combinations of algorithms -- ie it does not
   need pre-defined OIDs for specific combinations.  This identifier
   MUST be used in sa-CompositeSignature.identifier.

   id-alg-composite OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       iso(1)  identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4)
       enterprise(1) OpenCA(18227) Algorithms(2) id-alg-composite(1) }

   EDNOTE: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping.  We
   are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see Section 6.

   The following algorithm parameters MUST be included:

   CompositeParams ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF AlgorithmIdentifier




Ounsworth & Pala        Expires December 2, 2022                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs                   May 2022


   The signature's CompositeParams sequence MUST contain the same
   component algorithms listed in the same order as in the associated
   CompositePublicKey.

   The motivation for this variant is primarily for prototyping work
   prior to the standardization of algorithm identifiers for explicit
   combinations of algorithms.  However, the authors envision that this
   variant will remain relevant beyond full standardization for example
   in environments requiring very high levels of crypto agility, for
   example where clients support a large number of algorithms or where a
   large number of keys will be used at a time and it is therefore
   prohibitive to define algorithm identifiers for every combination of
   pairs, triples, quadtuples, etc of algorithms.

3.2.  Other Explicit Algorithms

   This variant provides a rigid way of specifying supported
   combinations of algorithms.

   The motivation for this variant is to make it easier to reference and
   enforce specific combinations of algorithms.  The authors envision
   this being useful for client-server negotiated protocols, protocol
   designers who wish to place constraints on allowable algorithm
   combinations in the protocol specification, as well as audited
   environments that wish to prove that only certain combinations will
   be supported by clients.

   Explicit algorithms must define a new signature algorithm which
   consists of:

   o  A new algorithm identifier OID for the explicit algorithm.

   o  The algorithm identifier OID and PUBLIC-KEY type of each component
      algorithm.

   o  Signature parameters either declared ABSENT, or defined with a
      type and encoding.

   See Appendix B for guidance on creating and registering OIDs for
   specific explicit combinations.

   For explicit algorithms, it is not necessary to carry a
   CompositeParams with the list of component algorithms in the
   signature algorithm params because clients can infer the expected
   component algorithms from the algorithm identifier.  The PARAMS is
   left optional because some types of component algorithms will require
   parameters to be carried, such as RSASSA-PSS-params as defined in

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs                   May 2022


   [RFC8017].  Explicit algorithms specifications MUST either define
   parameters as ABSENT, or define a type and encoding for parameters.

   In this variant, the signature is encoded as defined in Section 2.2,
   however the sa-CompositeSignature.identifier SHALL be an OID which is
   registered to represent a specific combination of component signature
   algorithms.  See Appendix C for examples.

4.  Composite Signature Processes

   This section specifies the processes for generating and verifying
   composite signatures.

   This process addresses algorithm strength uncertainty by providing
   the verifier with parallel signatures from all the component
   signature algorithms; thus forging the composite signature would
   require forging all of the component signatures.

4.1.  Composite Signature Generation Process

   Generation of a composite signature involves applying each component
   algorithm's signature process to the input message according to its
   specification, and then placing each component signature value into
   the CompositeSignatureValue structure defined in Section 2.2.

   The following process is used to generate composite signature values.

Input:
     K1, K2, .., Kn     Signing private keys. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     A1, A2, ... An     Component signature algorithms. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     M                  Message to be signed, an octet string

Output:
     S                  The signatures, a CompositeSignatureValue

Signature Generation Process:
   1. Generate the n component signatures independently,
      according to their algorithm specifications.

        for i := 1 to n
            Si := Sign( Ki, Ai, M )

   2. Encode each component signature S1, S2, .., Sn into a BIT STRING
      according to its algorithm specification.

        S ::= Sequence { S1, S2, .., Sn }

   3. Output S

   Note on composite inputs: the method of providing the list of
   component keys and algorithms is flexible and beyond the scope of
   this pseudo-code, for example they may be carried in
   CompositePrivateKey and CompositeParams structures.  It is also
   possible to genarate a composite signature that combines signatures
   from distinct keys stored in separate software or hardware keystores.
   Variations in the process to accomodate particular private key
   storage mechanisms are considered to be conformant to this document
   so long as it produces the same output as the process sketched above.

   Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed in ~~ Reference
   draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-pubkeys sec-composite-pub-keys ~~, no
   component signature may itself be a composite; ie the signature
   generation process MUST fail if one of the private keys K1, K2, ..,
   Kn is a composite with the OID id-alg-composite.

   A composite signature MUST produce, and include in the output, a
   signature value for every component key in the corresponding
   CompositePublicKey, and they MUST be in the same order; ie in the
   output, S1 MUST correspond to K1, S2 to K2, etc.  The authors
   recognize that there may be valid use cases for "subset signature
   generation"; see Section 7.2.1 for further discussion of security

   implications, and Section 5.1 for further discussion of backwards
   compatibility implications.

   For security when using a generic composite signature algorithm as
   defined in Section 3.1, the list of component signature algorithms
   A1, A2, .., An, which may be carried in a CompositeParams object,
   SHOULD be included in the signed message M to prevent an attacker
   from substituting a weaker algorithm which is compatible with the
   same public key.  This attack is not unique or new to the composite
   format.

4.2.  Composite Signature Verification Process

   Verification of a composite signature involves applying each
   component algorithm's verification process according to its
   specification.

   In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise,
   compliant applications MUST output "Valid signature" (true) if and
   only if all component signatures were successfully validated, and
   "Invalid signature" (false) otherwise.

   The following process is used to perform this verification.

        A1, A2, ... An     Component signature algorithms. See note
                           below on composite inputs.

   Output:
       Validity (bool)    "Valid signature" (true) if the composite
                           signature is valid, "Invalid signature"
                           (false) otherwise.

   Signature Verification Procedure::
      1. Check keys, signatures, and algorithms lists for consistency.

         If Error during Desequencing, or the three sequences have
         different numbers of elements, or any of the public keys
         P1, P2, .., Pn or algorithm identifiers A1, A2, .., An are
         composite with the OID id-alg-composite or an explic composite
         OID then output "Invalid signature" and stop.

      2. Check each component signature individually, according to its
          algorithm specification.
          If any fail, then the entire signature validation fails.

        for i := 1 to n
             if not verify( Pi, M, Si, Ai ), then
               output "Invalid signature"

         if all succeeded, then
           output "Valid signature"

   Note on composite inputs: the method of providing the list of
   component keys, algorithms and signatures is flexible and beyond the
   scope of this pseudo-code, for example they may be carried in
   CompositePublicKey, CompositeParams, and compositesignaturevalue
   structures.  It is also possible to verify a composite signature
   where the component public verification keys belong, for example, to
   separate X.509 certificates or cryptographic modules.  Variations in
   the process to accomodate particular public verification key storage
   mechanisms are considered to be conformant to this document so long
   as it produces the same output as the process sketched above.

   Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed in ~~ Reference
   draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys sec-composite-pub-keys ~~, no
   component signature may be composite; ie the signature verification
   procedure MUST fail if any of the public keys P1, P2, .., Pn or
   algorithm identifiers A1, A2, .., An are composite with the OID id-
   alg-composite.

   Some verification clients may include a policy mechanism for
   specifying acceptable subsets of algorithms.  In these cases,
   implementors MAY, in the interest of performance, modify the above
   process to skip one or more signature validations as per their local
   client policy.  See Section 7.2 for a discussion of associated risks.

   In the absence of such a policy machanism that can be easily updated
   to reflect new cryptanalytic breakthroughs, clients MUST perform
   signature verifications in the AND mode defined here.  See
   Section 7.2.1 for further discussion of security implications of
   subset signature verificationns, and Section 5.1 for further
   discussion of backwards compatibility implications.

5.  Implementation Considerations

   This section addresses practical issues of how this draft affects
   other protocols and standards.

   ~~~ BEGIN EDNOTE 10~~~

   EDNOTE 10: Possible topics to address:

   o  The size of these certs and cert chains.

   o  In particular, implications for (large) composite keys /
      signatures / certs on the handshake stages of TLS and IKEv2.

   o  If a cert in the chain is a composite cert then does the whole
      chain need to be of composite Certs?

   o  We could also explain that the root CA cert does not have to be of
      the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be transferred in
      the authentication exchange to save transport overhead and thus it
      can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.

   o  We could talk about overhead (size and processing).

   o  We could also discuss backwards compatibility.

   o  We could include a subsection about implementation considerations.

5.1.  Backwards Compabilitity

   As noted in the introduction, the post-quantum cryptographic
   migration will face challenges in both guaraneeing cryptographic
   stength against adversaries of unknown capabilities, as well as
   providing ease of magritation.  The composite mechanisms defined in
   this document primarily address cryptographic strength, however this
   secion contains notes on how backwards compatibility may be obtained.

   The term "ease of migration" is used here to mean that existing
   systems can be gracefully transitioned to the new technology without
   requiring large service disruptions or expensive upgrades.  The term
   "backwards compatibility" is used here to mean something more
   specific; that existing systems as they are deployed today can
   interoperate with the upgraded systems of the future.

   These migration and interoperability concerns need to be thought
   about in the context of various types of protocols that make use of
   X.509 and PKIX with relation to digital signature objects, from
   online negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and IKEv2
   [RFC7296], to non-negotiated asyncronous protocols such as S/MIME
   signed email [RFC8551], document signing such as in the context of
   the European eIDAS regulations [eIDAS2014], and publicly trusted code
   signing [codeSigningBRsv2.8], as well as myriad other standardized
   and proprietary protocols and applications that leverage CMS
   [RFC5652] signed structures.

5.1.1.  OR modes

   Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 make reference to subset signature
   generation and verification modes to achieve an OR relation between
   component signatures, where senders and / or receivers are permitted
   to ignore some component keys.  Some envisioned uses of this include
   environments where the client encounters a component signature
   algorithm for which it does not posess a compatible implementation
   but wishes to proceed with the signature verification using the
   subset of component signatures for which it does have compatible
   implementations.  Such a mechanism could be designed to provide ease
   of migration by allowing for composite keys to be distributed and
   used before all clients in the environment are fully upgraded, but it
   does not allow for full backwards compatibility since clients would
   at least need to be upgraded from their current state to be able to
   parse the composite structures.

5.1.2.  Parallel PKIs

   We present the term "Parallel PKI" to refer to the setup where a PKI
   end entity posesses two or more distinct public keys or certificates
   for the same identity (name), but containing keys for different
   cryptographic algorithms.  One could imagine a set of parallel PKIs
   where an existing PKI using legacy algorithms (RSA, ECC) is left
   operational during the post-quantum migration but is shadowed by one
   or more paralel PKIs using pure post quantum algorithms or composite
   algorithms (legacy and post-quantum).

   Equipped with a set of parallel public keys in this way, a runtime
   client would have the flexibility to choose which public key(s) or
   certifiate(s) to use in a given signature operation.

   For negotiated protocols, the runtime client could choose which
   public key(s) or certificate(s) to use based on the negotiated
   algorithms, or could combine two of the public keys for example in a
   non-composite hybrid method such as [draft-becker-guthrie-
   noncomposite-hybrid-auth-00] (NOTE: need kramdown formatting help
   with this ref) or [draft-guthrie-ipsecme-ikev2-hybrid-auth-00].  Note
   that it is possible to use the signature algorithms defined in
   Section 3 as a way to carry the multiple signature values generated
   by one of the non-composite public mechanism in protocols where it is
   easier to support the composite signature algorithms than to
   implement such a mechanism in the protocol itself.  There is also
   nothing precluding a composite public key from being one of the
   components used within a non-composite authentication operation; this
   may lead to greater convenience in setting up parallel PKI
   hierarchies that need to service a range of clients implementing
   different styles of post-quantum migration strategies.

   For non-negotiated protocols, the details for obtaining backwards
   compatibility will vary by protocol, but for example in CMS
   [RFC5652], the inclusion of multiple SignerInfo objects is often
   already treated as an OR relationship, so including one for each of
   the signer's parallel PKI public keys would, in many cases, have the
   desired effect of allowing the reciever to choose one they are
   compatible with and ignore the others, thus achieving full backwards
   compatibility.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The ASN.1 module OID is TBD.  The id-alg-composite OID is to be
   assigned by IANA.  The authors suggest that IANA assign an OID on the
   id-pkix arc:

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs                   May 2022


   id-alg-composite OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
       mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6) composite(??) }

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), it is obvious that
   clients performing signature verifications should be updated to fail
   to validate signatures using these algorithms.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since a single public
   key, certificate, or signature may contain a mixture of deprecated
   and non-deprecated algorithms.  Moreover, implementers may decide
   that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary security
   properties and are acceptable in combination even though neither
   algorithm is acceptable by itself.

   Specifying a modified verification algorithm to handle these
   situations is beyond the scope of this draft, but could be desirable
   as the subject of an application profile document, or to be up to the
   discretion of implementers.

   2. Check policy to see whether A1, A2, ..., An constitutes a valid
      combination of algorithms.

      if not checkPolicy(A1, A2, ..., An), then
        output "Invalid signature"

7.2.  OR Modes

7.2.1.  Subset Signature Generation

   This document defines a composite signature generation process in
   Section 4.1 wherethe signer MUST produce a signature value with each
   of their component private keys, this providing full protection of
   the content under all available component algorithms.

   The authors recognize that there may be cases where a client may wish
   to generate a composite signature that only uses a subset of the
   available component algorithms, for example to save bandwidth, or
   because a client has been issued a key for which it does not (yet)
   have implementations of all component algorithms.  This could be
   easily encoded by placing a NULL value into the corresponding field
   of the CompositeSignatureValue.  However, this mode was intentionally

   omitted from this specification as it trivially allows for stripping
   attacks where an attacker replaces a valid component signature value
   with NULL, thus reducing the security of the composite signature to
   the weakest of the available component algorithms.

   Implementors who wish to perform subset signature generations are
   advised to couple it with an out-of-band policy mechanism that limits
   the potential for stripping attacks.  Note that, in an effort to keep
   compliant implementations simple and secure, implementations claiming
   to be compliant with this draft MUST NOT generate subset signatures
   in this way, and MUST reject during verification any subset
   signatures that they encounter.

7.2.2.  Subset Signature Verification

   This document defines a composite signature verification process in
   Section 4.2 where the verifier verifies all component signatures and
   fails if any component fails.  The authors recognize that there will
   be scenarios where the verifier considers a single component
   algorithm -- or subset of component algorithms -- to provide
   sufficient security, and therefore for performance reasons wishes to
   skip the verification of one or more component signatures.

   -- harmonize this with Serge's blurb --

   Implementors who wish to perform subset signature verifications are
   advised to couple it with an out-of-band policy mechanism that can
   control the list of acceptable algorithm combinations, and keep this
   list up to date as new cryptanalytic advances are made.

   Risks:

   o  Failing to update client verification policy in response to
      advances in cryptanalysis

   o  Verifications of a subset of signatures leads to ambiguity in the
      security strength of the signature verification; ie if a message
      carries two signatures, one at 128 bits and the other at 112 bits
      of security and clients are verifying in an OR mode with flexible
      policy, then it becomes difficult to audit the security strength
      used at runtime.

   o  Moreover, verifying multiple algorithms provides security even in
      the event that one of the algorithms has already been broken, but
      knowledge of the break has not been made public yet.

A.1.  Combiner modes (KofN)

   For content commitment use-cases, such as legally-binding non-
   repudiation, the signer (whether it be a CA or an end entity) needs
   to be able to specify how its signature is to be interpreted and
   verified.

   For now we have removed combiner modes (AND, OR, KofN) from this
   draft, but we are still discussing how to incorporate this for the
   cases where it is needed (maybe a X.509 v3 extension, or a signature
   algorithm param).

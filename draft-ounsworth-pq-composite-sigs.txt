              Composite Signatures For Use In Internet PKI
                  draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs-08

Abstract

   The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history
   of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor
   the new incoming algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the
   required data lifetimes.  The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and
   elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptanalysis, while the incoming
   post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying
   mathematics as well as hardware and software implementations that
   have not had sufficient maturing time to rule out classical
   cryptanalytic attacks and implementation bugs.

   Cautious implementer may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such
   that an attacker would need to break all of them in order to
   compromise the data being protected.  For digital signatures, this is
   referred to as "dual", and for encryption key establishment this as
   referred to as "hybrid".  This document, and its companions, defines
   a specific instantiation of the dual and hybrid paradigm called
   "composite" where multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined to
   form a single key, signature, or key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
   such that they can be treated as a single atomic object at the
   protocol level.

   EDNOTE: the terms "dual" and "hybrid" are currently in flux.  We
   anticipate an Informational draft to normalize terminology, and will
   update this draft accordingly.

   This document defines the structures CompositeSignatureValue, and
   CompositeParams, which are sequences of the respective structure for
   each component algorithm.  The generic composite variant is defined
   which allows arbitrary combinations of signature algorithms to be
   used in the CompositeSignatureValue and CompositeParams structures
   without needing the combination to be pre-registered or pre-agreed.
   The explicit variant is also defined which allows for a set of
   signature algorithm identifier OIDs to be registered together as an
   explicit composite signature algorithm and assigned an OID.

   This document is intended to be coupled with corresponding documents
   that define the structure and semantics of composite public and
   private keys and encryption [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys],
   however may also be used with non-composite keys, such as when a
   protocol combines multiple certificates into a single cryptographic
   operation.

   *  hash-then-sign, and external hashing

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   ALGORITHM: A standardized cryptographic primitive, as well as any
   ASN.1 structures needed for encoding data and metadata needed to use
   the algorithm.  This document is primarily concerned with algorithms
   for producing digital signatures.

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   CLIENT: Any software that is making use of a cryptographic key.  This
   includes a signer, verifier, encrypter, decrypter.

   COMPONENT ALGORITHM: A single basic algorithm which is contained
   within a composite algorithm.

   COMPOSITE ALGORITHM: An algorithm which is a sequence of two or more
   component algorithms, as defined in Section 4.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   LEGACY: For the purposes of this document, a legacy algorithm is any
   cryptographic algorithm currently is use which is not believe to be
   resistant to quantum cryptanalysis.

   PKI: Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in [RFC5280].

   POST-QUANTUM ALGORITHM: Any cryptographic algorithm which is believed
   to be resistant to classical and quantum cryptanalysis, such as the
   algorithms being considered for standardization by NIST.

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

   SIGNATURE: A digital cryptographic signature, making no assumptions
   about which algorithm.

   STRIPPING ATTACK: An attack in which the attacker is able to
   downgrade the cryptographic object to an attacker-chosen subset of
   original set of component algorithms in such a way that it is not
   detectable by the receiver.  For example, substituting a composite
   public key or signature for a version with fewer components.

3.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not
   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had
   sufficient scrutiny and time to discover and fix implementation bugs.
   Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm migrations, the choice of
   when to migrate and which algorithms to migrate to, is not so clear.
   Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an
   entity's cryptographic identity to be composed of multiple public-key
   algorithms.

   The deployment of composite signatures using post-quantum algorithms
   will face two challenges

   *  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   *  Backwards compatibility: During the transition period, post-
      quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.

   This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength
   uncertainty concerns by building on [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys]
   by providing formats for encoding multiple signature values into
   existing public signature fields, as well as the process for
   validating a composite signature.  Backwards compatibility is
   addressed via using composite in conjunction with a non-composite
   hybrid mode such as that described in
   [I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth].

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that
   digital signatures are used within PKIX and CMS structures.

4.  Composite Signature Structures

   In order for signatures to be composed of multiple algorithms, we
   define encodings consisting of a sequence of signature primitives
   (aka "component algorithms") such that these structures can be used
   as a drop-in replacement for existing signature fields such as those
   found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS
   [RFC5652].

4.1.  Composite Keys

   A composite signature MAY be associated with a composite public key
   as defined in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys], but MAY also be
   associated with multiple public keys from different sources, for
   example multiple X.509 certificates, or multiple cryptographic
   modules.  In the latter case, composite signatures MAY be used as the
   mechanism for carrying multiple signatures in a non-composite
   authentication mechanism such as those described in
   [I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth].

4.1.1.  Key Usage Bits

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, then the composite public key associated with a
   composite signature MUST have a signing-type key usage.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a Certification Authority
   (CA) certificate that indicates a composite key, then any combination
   of the following values MAY be present:

   digitalSignature;
   nonRepudiation;
   keyCertSign; and
   cRLSign.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an End Entity (EE)
   certificate that indicates a composite key, then any combination of
   the following values MAY be present:

   digitalSignature; and
   nonRepudiation;

4.2.  CompositeSignatureValue

   The output of the composite signature algorithm is the DER encoding
   of the following structure:

   CompositeSignatureValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF BIT STRING

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs               January 2023


   Where each BIT STRING within the SEQUENCE is a signature value
   produced by one of the component keys.  It MUST contain one signature
   value produced by each component algorithm, and in the same order as
   in the associated CompositeParams object.

   A CompositeSignatureValue MUST contain the same number of component
   signatures as the corresponding public and private keys, and the
   order of component signature values MUST correspond to the component
   public keys.

   The choice of SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING, rather than for example a
   single BIT STRING containing the concatenated signature values, is to
   gracefully handle variable-length signature values by taking
   advantage of ASN.1's built-in length fields.

4.3.  Composite Signature Parameters

   Composite signature parameters are defined as follows and MUST be
   included in the composite signature AlgorithmIdentifier for the
   composite signature algorithm:

   CompositeParams ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF AlgorithmIdentifier

   The signature's CompositeParams sequence MUST contain the same
   component algorithms listed in the same order as in the associated
   CompositePublicKey.

4.4.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that composite signature
   data structures be represented by an octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

   In the interests of simplicity and avoiding compatibility issues,
   implementations that parse these structures MAY accept both BER and
   DER.

5.  Algorithm Identifiers

   This section defines the algorithm identifiers for explicit
   combinations.  For simplicity and prototyping purposes, the signature
   algorithm object identifiers specified in this document are the same
   as the composite key object Identifiers specified in {draft-
   ounsworth-pq-composite-keys}.  A proper implementation should not
   presume that the object ID of a composite key will be the same as its
   composite signature algorithm.

   This section is not intended to be exhaustive and other authors may
   define others composite signature algorithms so long as they are
   compatible with the structures and processes defined in this and
   companion public and private key documents.

   Some use-cases desire the flexibility for clients to use any
   combination of supported algorithms, while others desire the rigidity
   of explicitly-specified combinations of algorithms.

   The following sections will indicate the details for each explicit
   composite signature algorithms:

   Signature public key types:

   This definition provides a rigid way of specifying supported
   combinations of algorithms.

   The will make it easier to reference and enforce specific
   combinations of algorithms.  The authors envision this being useful
   for client-server negotiated protocols, protocol designers who wish
   to place constraints on allowable algorithm combinations in the
   protocol specification, as well as audited environments that wish to
   prove that only certain combinations will be supported by clients.

   See Appendix B for guidance on creating and registering OIDs for
   specific explicit combinations.

   For explicit algorithms, it is not necessary to carry a
   CompositeParams with the list of component algorithms in the
   signature algorithm parameters because clients can infer the expected
   component algorithms from the algorithm identifier.  The PARAMS is
   left optional because some types of component algorithms will require
   parameters to be carried, such as RSASSA-PSS-params as defined in
   [RFC8017].  Section 5.1 defines PARAMS ANY DEFINED BY ALGORITHM so
   that explicit algorithms may define params as ABSENT, use
   CompositeParams defined in Section 5.11 or use any other encoding
   that is appropriate.

   In this variant, the signature is encoded as defined in Section 5.1,
   however the sa-CompositeSignature.identifier SHALL be an OID which is
   registered to represent a specific combination of component signature
   algorithms.  See Appendix C for examples.

   TODO: What to do about hash functions?  Does Dilithium3 specify a
   hash function, or do we need to specify one?

   TODO: What to do about pre-hashing?  Cryptographic modules prefer to
   receive a hash of the message rather than the entire message.
   However, Dilithium starts with a hash of the message pre-pended with
   the public key mu := CRH( tr || m ) which provides domain-separation
   per public key.  Perhaps the right answer is that mu is also the hash
   value to be signed by ECDSA?

5.11.  sa-alg-composite (Generic Composite Signatures)

   The id-alg-composite object identifier is used for identifying a
   generic composite signature.  This algorithm allows arbitrary
   combinations of component signature algorithms to be used in the
   CompositeSignatureValue and CompositeParams structures without
   needing the combination to be pre-registered or standardized.  This
   identifier MUST be used in sa-CompositeSignature.identifier.

   id-alg-composite OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       iso(1)  identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4)
       enterprise(1) OpenCA(18227) Algorithms(2) id-alg-composite(1) }

   EDNOTE: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping.  We
   are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see Section 10.

   The following algorithm parameters MUST be included:

   CompositeParams ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF AlgorithmIdentifier

   The signature's CompositeParams sequence MUST contain the same
   component algorithms listed in the same order as in the associated
   CompositePublicKey.

   The motivation for this variant is primarily for prototyping work
   prior to the standardization of algorithm identifiers for explicit
   combinations of algorithms.  However, the authors envision that this
   variant will remain relevant beyond full standardization for example
   in environments requiring very high levels of crypto agility, for
   example where clients support a large number of algorithms or where a
   large number of keys will be used at a time and it is therefore
   prohibitive to define algorithm identifiers for every combination of
   pairs, triples, quadruples, etc of algorithms.

6.  Composite Signature Processes

   This section specifies the processes for generating and verifying
   composite signatures.

   This process addresses algorithm strength uncertainty by providing
   the verifier with parallel signatures from all the component
   signature algorithms; thus forging the composite signature would
   require forging all of the component signatures.

6.1.  Composite Signature Generation Process

   Generation of a composite signature involves applying each component
   algorithm's signature process to the input message according to its
   specification, and then placing each component signature value into
   the CompositeSignatureValue structure defined in Section 5.1.

   The following process is used to generate composite signature values.

Input:
     K1, K2, .., Kn     Signing private keys. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     A1, A2, ... An     Component signature algorithms. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     M                  Message to be signed, an octet string

Output:
     S                  The signatures, a CompositeSignatureValue

Signature Generation Process:
   1. Generate the n component signatures independently,
      according to their algorithm specifications.

        for i := 1 to n
            Si := Sign( Ki, Ai, M )

   2. Encode each component signature S1, S2, .., Sn into a BIT STRING
      according to its algorithm specification.

        S ::= Sequence { S1, S2, .., Sn }

   3. Output S

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs               January 2023


   Note on composite inputs: the method of providing the list of
   component keys and algorithms is flexible and beyond the scope of
   this pseudo-code, for example they may be carried in
   CompositePrivateKey and CompositeParams structures.  It is also
   possible to generate a composite signature that combines signatures
   from distinct keys stored in separate software or hardware keystores.
   Variations in the process to accommodate particular private key
   storage mechanisms are considered to be conformant to this document
   so long as it produces the same output as the process sketched above.

   Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed in
   [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys], no component signature may itself
   be a composite; ie the signature generation process MUST fail if one
   of the private keys K1, K2, .., Kn is a composite with the OID id-
   alg-composite.

   A composite signature MUST produce, and include in the output, a
   signature value for every component key in and include in the output,
   a signature value for every component key in the corresponding
   CompositePublicKey, and they MUST be in the same order; ie in the
   output, S1 MUST correspond to K1, S2 to K2, etc.  The authors
   recognize that there may be valid use cases for "subset signature
   generation"; see Section 11.2.1 for further discussion of security
   implications, and Section 7.1 for further discussion of backwards
   compatibility implications.

   For security when using a generic composite signature algorithm as
   defined in Section 5.11, the list of component signature algorithms
   A1, A2, .., An, which may be carried in a CompositeParams object,
   SHOULD be included in the signed message M to prevent an attacker
   from substituting a weaker algorithm which is compatible with the
   same public key.  This attack is not unique or new to the composite
   format.

6.2.  Composite Signature Verification Process

   Verification of a composite signature involves applying each
   component algorithm's verification process according to its
   specification.

   In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise,
   compliant applications MUST output "Valid signature" (true) if and
   only if all component signatures were successfully validated, and
   "Invalid signature" (false) otherwise.

   The following process is used to perform this verification.

  Input:
       P1, P2, .., Pn     Public verification keys. See note below on
                          composite inputs.

       M                  Message whose signature is to be verified,
                          an octet string

       S1, S2, .., Sn    Component signature values to be verified.
                         See note below on composite inputs.

       A1, A2, ... An     Component signature algorithms. See note
                          below on composite inputs.

  Output:
      Validity (bool)    "Valid signature" (true) if the composite
                          signature is valid, "Invalid signature"
                          (false) otherwise.

  Signature Verification Procedure::
     1. Check keys, signatures, and algorithms lists for consistency.

        If Error during Desequencing, or the three sequences have
        different numbers of elements, or any of the public keys
        P1, P2, .., Pn or algorithm identifiers A1, A2, .., An are
        composite with the OID id-alg-composite or an explicit composite
        OID then output "Invalid signature" and stop.

     2. Check each component signature individually, according to its
         algorithm specification.
         If any fail, then the entire signature validation fails.

       for i := 1 to n
            if not verify( Pi, M, Si, Ai ), then
              output "Invalid signature"

        if all succeeded, then
          output "Valid signature"

   Note on composite inputs: the method of providing the list of
   component keys, algorithms and signatures is flexible and beyond the
   scope of this pseudo-code, for example they may be carried in
   CompositePublicKey, CompositeParams, and compositesignaturevalue
   structures.  It is also possible to verify a composite signature
   where the component public verification keys belong, for example, to
   separate X.509 certificates or cryptographic modules.  Variations in
   the process to accommodate particular public verification key storage
   mechanisms are considered to be conformant to this document so long
   as it produces the same output as the process sketched above.

   Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed in
   [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys], no component signature may be
   composite; ie the signature verification procedure MUST fail if any
   of the public keys P1, P2, .., Pn or algorithm identifiers A1, A2,
   .., An are composite with the OID id-alg-composite.

   Some verification clients may include a policy mechanism for
   specifying acceptable subsets of algorithms.  In these cases,
   implementer MAY, in the interest of performance of compatibility,
   modify the above process to skip one or more signature validations as
   per their local client policy.  See Section 11.2 for a discussion of
   associated risks.

   In the absence of such a policy mechanism that can be easily updated
   to reflect new cryptanalytic breakthroughs, clients MUST perform
   signature verifications in the AND mode defined here.  See
   Section 11.2.1 for further discussion of security implications of
   subset signature verifications, and Section 7.1 for further
   discussion of backwards compatibility implications.

7.  Implementation Considerations

   This section addresses practical issues of how this draft affects
   other protocols and standards.

   ~~~ BEGIN EDNOTE 10~~~

   EDNOTE 10: Possible topics to address:

   *  The size of these certs and cert chains.

   *  In particular, implications for (large) composite keys /
      signatures / certs on the handshake stages of TLS and IKEv2.

   *  If a cert in the chain is a composite cert then does the whole
      chain need to be of composite Certs?

   *  We could also explain that the root CA cert does not have to be of
      the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be transferred in
      the authentication exchange to save transport overhead and thus it
      can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.

   *  We could talk about overhead (size and processing).

   *  We could also discuss backwards compatibility.

   *  We could include a subsection about implementation considerations.

7.1.  Backwards Compatibility

   As noted in the introduction, the post-quantum cryptographic
   migration will face challenges in both ensuring cryptographic
   strength against adversaries of unknown capabilities, as well as
   providing ease of migration.  The composite mechanisms defined in
   this document primarily address cryptographic strength, however this
   section contains notes on how backwards compatibility may be
   obtained.

   The term "ease of migration" is used here to mean that existing
   systems can be gracefully transitioned to the new technology without
   requiring large service disruptions or expensive upgrades.  The term
   "backwards compatibility" is used here to mean something more
   specific; that existing systems as they are deployed today can
   interoperate with the upgraded systems of the future.

   These migration and interoperability concerns need to be thought
   about in the context of various types of protocols that make use of
   X.509 and PKIX with relation to digital signature objects, from
   online negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and IKEv2
   [RFC7296], to non-negotiated asynchronous protocols such as S/MIME
   signed email [RFC8551], document signing such as in the context of
   the European eIDAS regulations [eIDAS2014], and publicly trusted code
   signing [codeSigningBRsv2.8], as well as myriad other standardized
   and proprietary protocols and applications that leverage CMS
   [RFC5652] signed structures.

7.1.1.  OR modes

   Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 make reference to subset signature
   generation and verification modes to achieve an OR relation between
   component signatures, where senders and / or receivers are permitted
   to ignore some component keys.  Some envisioned uses of this include
   environments where the client encounters a component signature
   algorithm for which it does not posses a compatible implementation
   but wishes to proceed with the signature verification using the
   subset of component signatures for which it does have compatible
   implementations.  Such a mechanism could be designed to provide ease
   of migration by allowing for composite keys to be distributed and
   used before all clients in the environment are fully upgraded, but it
   does not allow for full backwards compatibility since clients would
   at least need to be upgraded from their current state to be able to
   parse the composite structures.

7.1.2.  Parallel PKIs

   We present the term "Parallel PKI" to refer to the setup where a PKI
   end entity possesses two or more distinct public keys or certificates
   for the same identity (name), but containing keys for different
   cryptographic algorithms.  One could imagine a set of parallel PKIs
   where an existing PKI using legacy algorithms (RSA, ECC) is left
   operational during the post-quantum migration but is shadowed by one
   or more parallel PKIs using pure post quantum algorithms or composite
   algorithms (legacy and post-quantum).

   Equipped with a set of parallel public keys in this way, a client
   would have the flexibility to choose which public key(s) or
   certificate(s) to use in a given signature operation.

   For negotiated protocols, the client could choose which public key(s)
   or certificate(s) to use based on the negotiated algorithms, or could
   combine two of the public keys for example in a non-composite hybrid
   method such as [I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth] or
   [I-D.guthrie-ipsecme-ikev2-hybrid-auth].  Note that it is possible to
   use the signature algorithms defined in Section 5 as a way to carry
   the multiple signature values generated by one of the non-composite
   public mechanism in protocols where it is easier to support the
   composite signature algorithms than to implement such a mechanism in
   the protocol itself.  There is also nothing precluding a composite
   public key from being one of the components used within a non-
   composite authentication operation; this may lead to greater
   convenience in setting up parallel PKI hierarchies that need to
   service a range of clients implementing different styles of post-
   quantum migration strategies.

   For non-negotiated protocols, the details for obtaining backwards
   compatibility will vary by protocol, but for example in CMS
   [RFC5652], the inclusion of multiple SignerInfo objects is often
   already treated as an OR relationship, so including one for each of
   the signer's parallel PKI public keys would, in many cases, have the
   desired effect of allowing the receiver to choose one they are
   compatible with and ignore the others, thus achieving full backwards
   compatibility.

7.2.  External signatures

   EDNOTE: This section probably does not belong in this draft.  It
   probably belongs instead in the core Dilithium / Falcon specs such as
   [I-D.massimo-lamps-pq-sig-certificates].

   In many contexts, a signature or a verification operation is
   performed inside a cryptographic module where it is desirable to
   provide a message digest to the cryptographic module rather than
   streaming the entire message (which in some cases can be very large).

   Section 11.3 discusses security considerations around the traditional
   "hash-then-sign paradigm" where a simple hash of the message is taken
   and then the hash value is signed.  In general this is not desirable
   with the Dilithium and Falcon algorithms.

   This means that composite signature implementations MUST NOT perform
   a single message digest operation and then provide that digest value
   to all component algorithms.

   That said, the first step of both the Dilithium and Falcon algoritms
   is a keyed hash of the message.  This section considers modifications
   to the Dilithium and Falcon algorithms where the first hashing step
   is performed externally to the cryptographic module.

   That said, for use-cases where pre-hashing of messages for Dilithium
   or Falcon signatures is required for bandwidth or resource
   contraints, external hashing should be considered.  Depending on the
   algorithm chosen additional contraints on the format of the external
   hashing may be required to meet the security requirements of the
   algorithm.  The following subsections provide specific instructions
   for externalizing the message digest step of the Dilithium and Falcon
   Sign() and Verify() operations.

8.  Dilithium

   The Dilithium construction includes

   Gen():
   ...
   07 tr \in {0, 1}^384 := CRH(rho || t1)

   where CRH is a collision-resistant hash, and (rho, t1) is the public
   key.

   Sign(sk,M):
   ...
   10: mu \in {0, 1}^384 := CRH(tr || M)
         // which = CRH(CRH(rho || t1) || M)

   and

   Verify(pk, M, sigma):
   mu \in {0, 1}^384 := CRH(CRH(rho || t1) || M)

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs               January 2023


   These steps of the Sign() and Verify() operations MAY be externalized
   to a pre-computation step outside of the cryptographic module as they
   only need access to the public key (rho, t1) and the choice of hash
   function CRH, and since doing so does not affect interoperability of
   the signature algorithm.

9.  Falcon

   The Falcon construction includes

   Sign(m, sk, floor(beta^2)):
   1: r <- {0,1}^320 uniformly
   2: c <- HashToPoint(r||m, q, n)

   and

   Verify(m, sig, pk, floor(beta^2)):
   1: c <- HashToPoint(r||m, q, n)

   where HashToPoint is a SHAKE256-based construct that hashes the nonce
   r and the message m to a lattice point using the lattice parameters q
   and n.

   These steps of the Sign() and Verify() operations MAY be externalized
   to a pre-computation step outside of the cryptographic module as they
   only need access to the lattice parameters q and n, and since doing
   so does not affect interoperability of the signature algorithm.  This
   does require generation of r to be performed outside of the
   cryptographic module for Sign() operations, which may or may not have
   security implications depending on the implementation and runtime
   environment.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following in the SMI "Security for PKIX
   Algorithms (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.6)" registry:

   id-alg-composite OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)

11.1.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), then clients performing
   signatures or verifications should be updated to adhere to
   appropriate policies.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since a single public
   key, certificate, or signature may contain a mixture of deprecated
   and non-deprecated algorithms.  Moreover, implementers may decide
   that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary security
   properties and are acceptable in combination even though neither
   algorithm is acceptable by itself.

   Specifying a modified verification algorithm to handle these
   situations is beyond the scope of this draft, but could be desirable
   as the subject of an application profile document, or to be up to the
   discretion of implementers.

   2. Check policy to see whether A1, A2, ..., An constitutes a valid
      combination of algorithms.

      if not checkPolicy(A1, A2, ..., An), then
        output "Invalid signature"

11.2.  OR Modes

11.2.1.  Subset Signature Generation

   This document defines a composite signature generation process in
   Section 6.1 where the signer MUST produce a signature value with each
   of their component private keys, this providing full protection of
   the content under all available component algorithms.

   The authors recognize that there may be cases where a client may wish
   to generate a composite signature that only uses a subset of the
   available component algorithms, for example to save bandwidth, or
   because a client has been issued a key for which it does not (yet)
   have implementations of all component algorithms.  This could be
   easily encoded by placing a NULL value into the corresponding field
   of the CompositeSignatureValue.  However, this mode was intentionally
   omitted from this specification as it trivially allows for stripping
   attacks where an attacker replaces a valid component signature value
   with NULL, thus reducing the security of the composite signature to
   the weakest of the available component algorithms.

   Implementer who wish to perform subset signature generations are
   advised to couple it with an out-of-band policy mechanism that limits
   the potential for stripping attacks.  Note that, in an effort to keep
   compliant implementations simple and secure, implementations claiming
   to be compliant with this draft MUST NOT generate subset signatures
   in this way, and MUST reject during verification any subset
   signatures that they encounter.

11.2.2.  Subset Signature Verification

   This document defines a composite signature verification process in
   Section 6.2 where the verifier verifies all component signatures and
   fails if any component fails.  The authors recognize that there will
   be scenarios where the verifier considers a single component
   algorithm -- or subset of component algorithms -- to provide
   sufficient security, and therefore for performance reasons wishes to
   skip the verification of one or more component signatures.

   -- harmonize this with Serge's blurb --

   Implementers who wish to perform subset signature verifications are
   advised to couple it with an out-of-band policy mechanism that can
   control the list of acceptable algorithm combinations, and keep this
   list up to date as new cryptanalytic advances are made.

   Risks:

   *  Failing to update client verification policy in response to
      advances in cryptanalysis

   *  Verifications of a subset of signatures leads to ambiguity in the
      security strength of the signature verification; ie if a message
      carries two signatures, one at 128 bits and the other at 112 bits
      of security and clients are verifying in an OR mode with flexible
      policy, then it becomes difficult to audit the security strength
      used at runtime.

   *  Moreover, verifying multiple algorithms provides security even in
      the event that one of the algorithms has already been broken, but
      knowledge of the break has not been made public yet.

11.3.  Do not hash-then-sign

   In the hash-then-sign paradigm, the message to be signed is hashed
   externally to the signature primitive, and then the hash value is
   signed.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs               January 2023


   The hash-then-sign paradigm is required, for example, with RSA
   signatures in order to sign messages larger than the RSA modulus.
   Hash-then-sign also gives performance and bandwidth benefits, for
   example, when the signature is performed by a networked cryptographic
   appliance since you only need to send a small hash value rather than
   streaming the entire message.

   With Dilithium and Falcon signatures it is not recommended to pre-
   hash for the following reasons:

   The Dilithium construction includes

   Sign(sk,M):
   10: mu \in {0, 1}^384 := CRH(tr || M)

   where CRH is any collision-resistant hash function and tr is a
   component of the secret key.  This provides strong security against
   pre-computed collision attacks since an attacker has no knowledge of
   tr and provides per-key hash-domain separation of the message to be
   signed.

   The Falcon construction includes

   Sign (m, sk, beta^2):
   1: r <- {0, 1}^320 uniformly
   2: c <- HashToPoint(r || m, q, n)

   where HashToPoint is a SHAKE-256-based construct.  This provides
   strong security against pre-computed collision attacks since an
   attacker has no a-priori knowledge of r and provides per-signature
   hash-domain separation of the message to be signed.

   If the message to be signed is pre-hashed, for example m0 = SHA256(m)
   and then m0 provided to Dilithium or Falcon to sign, then you have
   re-introduced the collision problem since two messages m1 and m2
   where SHA256(m1) == SHA256(m2) will result in a single Falcon or
   Dilithium signature value which is simultaneously valid for both m1
   and m2.  This removes the extra collision resistance built in to the
   Dilithium and Falcon primitives and reduces it to the collision
   resistance strength of the underlying hash function.  For this reason
   it is in general not recommended to pre-hash when using Dilithium or
   Falcon except in cases where the implementor is comfortable with this
   reduction in security.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs               January 2023


   Therefore, for the purpose of interoperability of composite
   signatures, signature alogrithms defined in this version of this
   document do not pre-hash messages for Dilithium and Falcon.  If pre-
   hashed versions of these signatures are also desired, then separate
   signature algorithms will need to be defined.

   EDNOTE: Sync this with the authors of the Dilithium and Falcon
   signatures specs for LAMPS.

A.1.  Combiner modes (KofN)

   For content commitment use-cases, such as legally-binding non-
   repudiation, the signer (whether it be a CA or an end entity) needs
   to be able to specify how its signature is to be interpreted and
   verified.

   For now we have removed combiner modes (AND, OR, KofN) from this
   draft, but we are still discussing how to incorporate this for the
   cases where it is needed (maybe a X.509 v3 extension, or a signature
   algorithm param).

              Composite Signatures For Use In Internet PKI
                  draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs-12

Abstract

   The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history
   of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor
   the new incoming algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the
   required data lifetimes.  The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and
   elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptanalysis, while the incoming
   post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying
   mathematics as well as hardware and software implementations that
   have not had sufficient maturing time to rule out classical
   cryptanalytic attacks and implementation bugs.

   Cautious implementers may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such
   that an attacker would need to break all of them in order to
   compromise the data being protected using either a Post-Quantum /
   Traditional Hybrid, Post-Quantum / Post-Quantum Hybrid, or
   combinations thereof.  This document, and its companions, defines a
   specific instantiation of hybrid paradigm called "composite" where
   multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined to form a single key
   or signature such that they can be treated as a single atomic object
   at the protocol level.

   This document defines the structures CompositeSignaturePublicKey,
   CompositeSignaturePrivateKey and CompositeSignatureValue, which are
   sequences of the respective structure for each component algorithm.
   Composite signature algorithm identifiers are specified in this
   document which represent the explicit combinations of the underlying
   component algorithms.

3.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not
   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had
   sufficient scrutiny and time to discover and fix implementation bugs.
   Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm migrations, the choice of
   when to migrate and which algorithms to migrate to, is not so clear.
   Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an
   entity's cryptographic identity to be composed of multiple public-key
   algorithms.

   Cautious implementers may wish to combine cryptographic algorithms
   such that an attacker would need to break all of them in order to
   compromise the data being protected.  Such mechanisms are referred to
   as Post-Quantum / Traditional Hybrids
   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology].

   PQ/T Hybrid cryptography can, in general, provide solutions to two
   migration problems:

   *  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   *  Ease-of-migration: During the transition period, systems will
      require mechanisms that allow for staged migrations from fully
      classical to fully post-quantum-aware cryptography.

   *  Safeguard against faulty algorithm implementations and compromised
      keys: Even for long known algorithms there is a non-negligible
      risk of severe implementation faults.  Latest examples are the
      ROCA attack and ECDSA psychic signatures.  Using more than one
      algorithms will mitigate these risks.

   This document defines a specific instantiation of the PQ/T Hybrid
   paradigm called "composite" where multiple cryptographic algorithms
   are combined to form a single signature such that it can be treated
   as a single atomic algorithm at the protocol level.  Composite
   algorithms address algorithm strength uncertainty because the
   composite algorithm remains strong so long as one of its components
   remains strong.  Concrete instantiations of composite signature
   algorithms are provided based on ML-DSA, Falcon, RSA and ECDSA.
   Backwards compatibility is not directly covered in this document, but
   is the subject of Appendix B.2.

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that
   digital signatures are used within PKIX and CMS structures.  For a
   more detailed use-case discussion for composite signatures, the
   reader is encouraged to look at [I-D.vaira-pquip-pqc-use-cases]

3.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   ALGORITHM: A standardized cryptographic primitive, as well as any
   ASN.1 structures needed for encoding data and metadata needed to use
   the algorithm.  This document is primarily concerned with algorithms
   for producing digital signatures.

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   CLIENT: Any software that is making use of a cryptographic key.  This
   includes a signer, verifier, encrypter, decrypter.

   COMPONENT ALGORITHM: A single basic algorithm which is contained
   within a composite algorithm.

   COMPOSITE ALGORITHM: An algorithm which is a sequence of two or more
   component algorithms, as defined in Section 4.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   LEGACY: For the purposes of this document, a legacy algorithm is any
   cryptographic algorithm currently is use which is not believe to be
   resistant to quantum cryptanalysis.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs              February 2024


   PKI: Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in [RFC5280].

   POST-QUANTUM ALGORITHM: Any cryptographic algorithm which is believed
   to be resistant to classical and quantum cryptanalysis, such as the
   algorithms being considered for standardization by NIST.

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

   SIGNATURE: A digital cryptographic signature, making no assumptions
   about which algorithm.

   STRIPPING ATTACK: An attack in which the attacker is able to
   downgrade the cryptographic object to an attacker-chosen subset of
   original set of component algorithms in such a way that it is not
   detectable by the receiver.  For example, substituting a composite
   public key or signature for a version with fewer components.

3.2.  Composite Design Philosophy

   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology] defines composites as:

      _Composite Cryptographic Element_: A cryptographic element that
      incorporates multiple component cryptographic elements of the same
      type in a multi-algorithm scheme.

   Composite keys as defined here follow this definition and should be
   regarded as a single key that performs a single cryptographic
   operation such key generation, signing, verifying, encapsulating, or
   decapsulating -- using its internal sequence of component keys as if
   they form a single key.  This generally means that the complexity of
   combining algorithms can and should be handled by the cryptographic
   library or cryptographic module, and the single composite public key,
   private key, and ciphertext can be carried in existing fields in
   protocols such as PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280],
   CMS [RFC5652], and the Trust Anchor Format [RFC5914].  In this way,
   composites achieve "protocol backwards-compatibility" in that they
   will drop cleanly into any protocol that accepts signature algorithms
   without requiring any modification of the protocol to handle multiple
   keys.

3.3.  Composite Signatures

   Here we define the signature mechanism in which a signature is a
   cryptographic primitive that consists of three algorithms:

   *  KeyGen() -> (pk, sk): A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
      which generates a public key pk and a secret key sk.



Ounsworth, et al.        Expires 17 August 2024                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs              February 2024


   *  Sign(sk, Message) -> (signature): A signing algorithm which takes
      as input a secret key sk and a Message, and outputs a signature

   *  Verify(pk, Message, signature) -> true or false: A verification
      algorithm which takes as input a public key, a Message and
      signature and outputs true if the signature and public key can be
      used to verify the message.  Thus it proves the Message was signed
      with the secret key associated with the public key and verifies
      the integrity of the Message.  If the signature and public key
      cannot verify the Message, it returns false.

   A composite signature allows two or more underlying signature
   algorithms to be combined into a single cryptographic signature
   operation and can be used for applications that require signatures.

3.3.1.  Composite KeyGen

   The KeyGen() -> (pk, sk) of a composite signature algorithm will
   perform the KeyGen() of the respective component signature algorithms
   and it produces a composite public key pk as per Section 4.2 and a
   composite secret key sk is per Section 4.3.  The component keys MUST
   be uniquely generated for each component key of a Composite and MUST
   NOT be used in any other keys or as a standalone key.

3.3.2.  Composite Sign

   Generation of a composite signature involves applying each component
   algorithm's signature process to the input message according to its
   specification, and then placing each component signature value into
   the CompositeSignatureValue structure defined in Section 5.1.

   The following process is used to generate composite signature values.

Sign (sk, Message) -> (signature)
Input:
     K1, K2             Signing private keys for each component. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     A1, A2             Component signature algorithms. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     Message            The Message to be signed, an octet string

     HASH               The Message Digest Algorithm used for pre-hashing.  See section
                        on pre-hashing below.

     OID                The Composite Signature String Algorithm Name converted
                        from ASCII to bytes.  See section on OID concatenation
                        below.

Output:
     signature          The composite signature, a CompositeSignatureValue

Signature Generation Process:

   1. Compute a Hash of the Message

         M' = HASH(Message)

   2. Generate the n component signatures independently,
      according to their algorithm specifications.

         S1 := Sign( K1, A1, DER(OID) || M' )
         S2 := Sign( K2, A2, DER(OID) || M' )

   3. Encode each component signature S1 and S2 into a BIT STRING
      according to its algorithm specification.

        signature ::= Sequence { S1, S2 }

   4. Output signature

   Note on composite inputs: the method of providing the list of
   component keys and algorithms is flexible and beyond the scope of
   this pseudo-code.  When passed to the Composite Sign(sk, Message) API
   the sk is a CompositePrivateKey.  It is possible to construct a
   CompositePrivateKey from component keys stored in separate software
   or hardware keystores.  Variations in the process to accommodate
   particular private key storage mechanisms are considered to be
   conformant to this document so long as it produces the same output as
   the process sketched above.

   Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed, no component
   signature may itself be a composite; ie the signature generation
   process MUST fail if one of the private keys K1 or K2 is a composite.

   A composite signature MUST produce, and include in the output, a
   signature value for every component key in the corresponding
   CompositePublicKey, and they MUST be in the same order; ie in the
   output, S1 MUST correspond to K1, S2 to K2.

3.3.3.  Composite Verify

   Verification of a composite signature involves applying each
   component algorithm's verification process according to its
   specification.

   Compliant applications MUST output "Valid signature" (true) if and
   only if all component signatures were successfully validated, and
   "Invalid signature" (false) otherwise.

   The following process is used to perform this verification.

Composite Verify(pk, Message, signature)
Input:
     P1, P2             Public verification keys. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     Message            Message whose signature is to be verified,
                        an octet string

     signature          CompositeSignatureValue containing the component
                        signature values (S1 and S2) to be verified.

     A1, A2             Component signature algorithms. See note
                        below on composite inputs.

     HASH               The Message Digest Algorithm for pre-hashing.  See
                        section on pre-hashing the message below.

     OID                The Composite Signature String Algorithm Name converted
                        from ASCII to bytes.  See section on OID concatenation
                        below

Output:
    Validity (bool)    "Valid signature" (true) if the composite
                        signature is valid, "Invalid signature"
                        (false) otherwise.

Signature Verification Procedure::
   1. Check keys, signatures, and algorithms lists for consistency.

      If Error during Desequencing, or the sequences have
      different numbers of elements, or any of the public keys
      P1 or P2 and the algorithm identifiers A1 or A2 are
      composite then output "Invalid signature" and stop.

   2. Compute a Hash of the Message

         M' = HASH(Message)

   3. Check each component signature individually, according to its
       algorithm specification.
       If any fail, then the entire signature validation fails.

       if not verify( P1, DER(OID) || M', S1, A1 ) then
            output "Invalid signature"
       if not verify( P2, DER(OID) || M', S2, A2 ) then
            output "Invalid signature"

       if all succeeded, then
        output "Valid signature"

          Figure 2: Composite Verify(pk, Message, signature)

   Note on composite inputs: the method of providing the list of
   component keys and algorithms is flexible and beyond the scope of
   this pseudo-code.  When passed to the Composite Verify(pk, Message,
   signature) API the pk is a CompositePublicKey.  It is possible to
   construct a CompositePublicKey from component keys stored in separate
   software or hardware keystores.  Variations in the process to
   accommodate particular private key storage mechanisms are considered
   to be conformant to this document so long as it produces the same
   output as the process sketched above.

   Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed, no component
   signature may itself be a composite; ie the signature generation
   process MUST fail if one of the private keys K1 or K2 is a composite.

3.5.  PreHashing the Message

   As noted in the composite signature generation process and composite
   signature verification process, the Message should be pre-hashed into
   M' with the digest algorithm specified in the composite signature
   algorithm identifier.  The choice of the digest algorithm was chosen
   with the following criteria:

   1.  For composites paired with RSA or ECDSA, the hashing algorithm
       SHA256 or SHA512 is used as part of the RSA or ECDSA signature
       algorithm and is therefore also used as the composite prehashing
       algorithm.

   2.  For ML-DSA signing a digest of the message is allowed as long as
       the hash function provides at least y bits of classical security
       strength against both collision and second preimage attacks.  For
       MLDSA44 y is 128 bits, MLDSA65 y is 192 bits and for MLDSA87 y is
       256 bits.  Therefore SHA256 is paired with RSA and ECDSA with
       MLDSA44 and SHA512 is paired with RSA and ECDSA with MLDSA65 and
       MLDSA87 to match the appropriate security strength.

   3.  Ed25519 [RFC8032] uses SHA512 internally, therefore SHA512 is
       used to pre-hash the message when Ed25519 is a component
       algorithm.

   4.  Ed448 [RFC8032] uses SHAKE256 internally, but to reduce the set
       of prehashing algorihtms, SHA512 was selected to pre-hash the
       message when Ed448 is a component algorithm.

   5.  TODO: For Falcon signing it is expected prehashing digest
       accomodations will be allowed.

3.6.  Algorithm Selection Criteria

   The composite algorithm combinations defined in this document were
   chosen according to the following guidelines:

   1.  A single RSA combination is provided at a key size of 3072 bits,
       matched with NIST PQC Level 3 algorithms.

   2.  Elliptic curve algorithms are provided with combinations on each
       of the NIST [RFC6090], Brainpool [RFC5639], and Edwards [RFC7748]
       curves.  NIST PQC Levels 1 - 3 algorithms are matched with
       256-bit curves, while NIST levels 4 - 5 are matched with 384-bit
       elliptic curves.  This provides a balance between matching
       classical security levels of post-quantum and traditional
       algorithms, and also selecting elliptic curves which already have
       wide adoption.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs              February 2024


   3.  NIST level 1 candidates are provided, matched with 256-bit
       elliptic curves, intended for constrained use cases.

   If other combinations are needed, a separate specification should be
   submitted to the IETF LAMPS working group.  To ease implementation,
   these specifications are encouraged to follow the construction
   pattern of the algorithms specified in this document.

   The composite structures defined in this specification allow only for
   pairs of algorithms.  This also does not preclude future
   specification from extending these structures to define combinations
   with three or more components.

4.  Composite Signature Structures

   In order for signatures to be composed of multiple algorithms, we
   define encodings consisting of a sequence of signature primitives
   (aka "component algorithms") such that these structures can be used
   as a drop-in replacement for existing signature fields such as those
   found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS
   [RFC5652].

4.1.  pk-CompositeSignature

   The following ASN.1 Information Object Class is a template to be used
   in defining all composite Signature public key types.

   pk-CompositeSignature {OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id,
     FirstPublicKeyType,SecondPublicKeyType}
       PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
         IDENTIFIER id
         KEY SEQUENCE {
           firstPublicKey BIT STRING (CONTAINING FirstPublicKeyType),
           secondPublicKey BIT STRING (CONTAINING SecondPublicKeyType)
         }
         PARAMS ARE absent
         CERT-KEY-USAGE { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign}
       }

   As an example, the public key type pk-MLDSA65-ECDSA-P256-SHA256 is
   defined as:

   pk-MLDSA65-ECDSA-P256-SHA256 PUBLIC-KEY ::=
     pk-CompositeSignature{ id-MLDSA65-ECDSA-P256-SHA256,
     OCTET STRING, ECPoint}

   The full set of key types defined by this specification can be found
   in the ASN.1 Module in Section 7.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs              February 2024


4.2.  CompositeSignaturePublicKey

   Composite public key data is represented by the following structure:

   CompositeSignaturePublicKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF BIT STRING

   A composite key MUST contain two component public keys.  The order of
   the component keys is determined by the definition of the
   corresponding algorithm identifier as defined in section Section 6.

   Some applications may need to reconstruct the SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   objects corresponding to each component public key.  Table 3 in
   Section 6 provides the necessary mapping between composite and their
   component algorithms for doing this reconstruction.  This also
   motivates the design choice of SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING instead of
   SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING; using BIT STRING allows for easier
   transcription between CompositeSignaturePublicKey and
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo.

   When the CompositeSignaturePublicKey must be provided in octet string
   or bit string format, the data structure is encoded as specified in
   Section 4.4.

   Component keys of a CompositeSignaturePublicKey MUST NOT be used in
   any other type of key or as a standalone key.

4.3.  CompositeSignaturePrivateKey

   Usecases that require an interoperable encoding for composite private
   keys, such as when private keys are carried in PKCS #12 [RFC7292],
   CMP [RFC4210] or CRMF [RFC4211] MUST use the following structure.

   CompositeSignaturePrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF OneAsymmetricKey

   Each element is a OneAsymmetricKey` [RFC5958] object for a component
   private key.

   The parameters field MUST be absent.

   The order of the component keys is the same as the order defined in
   Section 4.2 for the components of CompositeSignaturePublicKey.










Ounsworth, et al.        Expires 17 August 2024                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs              February 2024


   When a CompositeSignaturePrivateKey is conveyed inside a
   OneAsymmetricKey structure (version 1 of which is also known as
   PrivateKeyInfo) [RFC5958], the privateKeyAlgorithm field SHALL be set
   to the corresponding composite algorithm identifier defined according
   to Section 6, the privateKey field SHALL contain the
   CompositeSignaturePrivateKey, and the publicKey field MUST NOT be
   present.  Associated public key material MAY be present in the
   CompositeSignaturePrivateKey.

   In some usecases the private keys that comprise a composite key may
   not be represented in a single structure or even be contained in a
   single cryptographic module; for example if one component is within
   the FIPS boundary of a cryptographic module and the other is not; see
   {sec-fips} for more discussion.  The establishment of correspondence
   between public keys in a CompositeSignaturePublicKey and private keys
   not represented in a single composite structure is beyond the scope
   of this document.

   Component keys of a CompositeSignaturePrivateKey MUST NOT be used in
   any other type of key or as a standalone key.

4.4.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that the composite public
   key and composite private key data structures be represented by an
   octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

   CompositeSignaturePublicKeyOs ::= OCTET STRING (CONTAINING CompositeSignaturePublicKey ENCODED BY der)

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

   CompositeSignaturePublicKeyBs ::= BIT STRING (CONTAINING CompositeSignaturePublicKey ENCODED BY der)

   In the interests of simplicity and avoiding compatibility issues,
   implementations that parse these structures MAY accept both BER and
   DER.

4.5.  Key Usage Bits

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, then the composite public key associated with a
   composite signature MUST have a signing-type key usage.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a Certification Authority
   (CA) certificate that indicates a composite key, then any combination
   of the following values MAY be present:

   digitalSignature;
   nonRepudiation;
   keyCertSign; and
   cRLSign.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an End Entity (EE)
   certificate that indicates a composite key, then any combination of
   the following values MAY be present:

   digitalSignature; and
   nonRepudiation;

5.  Composite Signature Structures

5.1.  sa-CompositeSignature

   The ASN.1 algorithm object for a composite signature is:

   sa-CompositeSignature {
     OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id,
       PUBLIC-KEY:publicKeyType }
       SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM ::= {
           IDENTIFIER id
           VALUE CompositeSignatureValue
           PARAMS ARE absent
           PUBLIC-KEYS { publicKeyType }
       }

   The following is an explanation how SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM elements are
   used to create Composite Signatures:

    +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+

                                  Table 2

5.2.  CompositeSignatureValue

   The output of the composite signature algorithm is the DER encoding
   of the following structure:

   CompositeSignatureValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF BIT STRING

   Where each BIT STRING within the SEQUENCE is a signature value
   produced by one of the component keys.  It MUST contain one signature
   value produced by each component algorithm, and in the same order as
   specified in the object identifier.

   The choice of SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF BIT STRING, rather than for
   example a single BIT STRING containing the concatenated signature
   values, is to gracefully handle variable-length signature values by
   taking advantage of ASN.1's built-in length fields.

6.  Algorithm Identifiers

   This section defines the algorithm identifiers for explicit
   combinations.  For simplicity and prototyping purposes, the signature
   algorithm object identifiers specified in this document are the same
   as the composite key object Identifiers.  A proper implementation
   should not presume that the object ID of a composite key will be the
   same as its composite signature algorithm.

   This section is not intended to be exhaustive and other authors may
   define others composite signature algorithms so long as they are
   compatible with the structures and processes defined in this and
   companion public and private key documents.

   Some use-cases desire the flexibility for clients to use any
   combination of supported algorithms, while others desire the rigidity
   of explicitly-specified combinations of algorithms.

   The following table summarizes the details for each explicit
   composite signature algorithms:

   The OID referenced are TBD for prototyping only, and the following
   prefix is used for each:

   replace <CompSig> with the String "2.16.840.1.114027.80.8.1"

   Therefore <CompSig>.1 is equal to 2.16.840.1.114027.80.8.1.1

   The table above contains everything needed to implement the listed
   explicit composite algorithms.  See the ASN.1 module in section
   Section 7 for the explicit definitions of the above Composite
   signature algorithms.

   Full specifications for the referenced algorithms can be found as
   follows:

   *  _MLDSA_: [I-D.ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates] and
      [FIPS.204-ipd]

   *  _ECDSA_: [RFC5480]

   *  _Ed25519 / Ed448_: [RFC8410]

   *  _Falcon_: TBD

   *  _RSAES-PKCS-v1_5_: [RFC8017]

   *  _RSASSA-PSS_: [RFC8017]

6.1.  Notes on id-MLDSA44-RSA2048-PSS-SHA256

   Use of RSA-PSS [RFC8017] deserves a special explanation.

   The RSA component keys MUST be generated at the 2048-bit security
   level in order to match with ML-DSA-44

   As with the other composite signature algorithms, when id-
   MLDSA44-RSA2048-PSS-SHA256 is used in an AlgorithmIdentifier, the
   parameters MUST be absent. id-MLDSA44-RSA2048-PSS-SHA256 SHALL
   instantiate RSA-PSS with the following parameters:

                  +==========================+=========+
                  | RSA-PSS Parameter        | Value   |
                  +==========================+=========+

   *  SHA-256 is defined in [RFC6234].

6.2.  Notes on id-MLDSA65-RSA3072-PSS-SHA512

   The RSA component keys MUST be generated at the 3072-bit security
   level in order to match with ML-DSA-65.

   As with the other composite signature algorithms, when id-
   MLDSA65-RSA3072-PSS-SHA512 is used in an AlgorithmIdentifier, the
   parameters MUST be absent. id-MLDSA65-RSA3072-PSS-SHA512 SHALL
   instantiate RSA-PSS with the following parameters:

                  +==========================+=========+
                  | RSA-PSS Parameter        | Value   |
                  +==========================+=========+

                  | Message Digest Algorithm | SHA-512 |
                  +--------------------------+---------+

                     Table 5: RSA-PSS 3072 Parameters

   where:

   *  Mask Generation Function (mgf1) is defined in [RFC8017]

   *  SHA-512 is defined in [RFC6234].

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a value from the "SMI Security for PKIX
   Module Identifier" registry [RFC7299] for the included ASN.1 module,
   and allocate values from "SMI Security for PKIX Algorithms" to
   identify the fourteen Algorithms defined within.

8.1.  Object Identifier Allocations

   EDNOTE to IANA: OIDs will need to be replaced in both the ASN.1
   module and in Table 3.

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), then clients performing
   signatures or verifications should be updated to adhere to
   appropriate policies.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since implementers may
   decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary
   security properties and are acceptable in combination even though one
   or both algorithms are deprecated for individual use.  As such, a
   single composite public key or certificate may contain a mixture of
   deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms.

   Since composite algorithms are registered independently of their
   component algorithms, their deprecation can be handled indpendently
   from that of their component algorithms.  For example a cryptographic
   policy might continue to allow id-MLDSA65-ECDSA-P256-SHA256 even
   after ECDH-P256 is deprecated.

Appendix B.  Implementation Considerations

B.1.  FIPS certification

   One of the primary design goals of this specification is for the
   overall composite algorithm to be able to be considered FIPS-approved
   even when one of the component algorithms is not.

   Implementors seeking FIPS certification of a composite Signature
   algorithm where only one of the component algorithms has been FIPS-
   validated or FIPS-approved should credit the FIPS-validated component
   algorithm with full security strength, the non-FIPS-validated
   component algorith with zero security, and the overall composite
   should be considered full strength and thus FIPS-approved.

   The authors wish to note that this gives composite algorithms great
   future utility both for future cryptographic migrations as well as
   bridging across jurisdictions; for example defining composite
   algorithms which combine FIPS cryptography with cryptography from a
   different national standards body.

B.2.  Backwards Compatibility

   The term "backwards compatibility" is used here to mean something
   more specific; that existing systems as they are deployed today can
   interoperate with the upgraded systems of the future.  This draft
   explicitly does not provide backwards compatibility, only upgraded
   systems will understand the OIDs defined in this document.

   If backwards compatibility is required, then additional mechanisms
   will be needed.  Migration and interoperability concerns need to be
   thought about in the context of various types of protocols that make
   use of X.509 and PKIX with relation to digital signature objects,
   from online negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and IKEv2
   [RFC7296], to non-negotiated asynchronous protocols such as S/MIME
   signed email [RFC8551], document signing such as in the context of
   the European eIDAS regulations [eIDAS2014], and publicly trusted code
   signing [codeSigningBRsv2.8], as well as myriad other standardized
   and proprietary protocols and applications that leverage CMS
   [RFC5652] signed structures.  Composite simplifies the protocol
   design work because it can be implemented as a signature algorithm
   that fits into existing systems.

B.2.1.  Parallel PKIs

   We present the term "Parallel PKI" to refer to the setup where a PKI
   end entity possesses two or more distinct public keys or certificates
   for the same identity (name), but containing keys for different
   cryptographic algorithms.  One could imagine a set of parallel PKIs
   where an existing PKI using legacy algorithms (RSA, ECC) is left
   operational during the post-quantum migration but is shadowed by one
   or more parallel PKIs using pure post quantum algorithms or composite
   algorithms (legacy and post-quantum).

   Equipped with a set of parallel public keys in this way, a client
   would have the flexibility to choose which public key(s) or
   certificate(s) to use in a given signature operation.

   For negotiated protocols, the client could choose which public key(s)
   or certificate(s) to use based on the negotiated algorithms, or could
   combine two of the public keys for example in a non-composite hybrid
   method such as [I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth] or
   [I-D.guthrie-ipsecme-ikev2-hybrid-auth].  Note that it is possible to
   use the signature algorithms defined in Section 6 as a way to carry
   the multiple signature values generated by one of the non-composite
   public mechanism in protocols where it is easier to support the
   composite signature algorithms than to implement such a mechanism in
   the protocol itself.  There is also nothing precluding a composite
   public key from being one of the components used within a non-
   composite authentication operation; this may lead to greater
   convenience in setting up parallel PKI hierarchies that need to
   service a range of clients implementing different styles of post-
   quantum migration strategies.

   For non-negotiated protocols, the details for obtaining backwards
   compatibility will vary by protocol, but for example in CMS
   [RFC5652], the inclusion of multiple SignerInfo objects is often

   already treated as an OR relationship, so including one for each of
   the signer's parallel PKI public keys would, in many cases, have the
   desired effect of allowing the receiver to choose one they are
   compatible with and ignore the others, thus achieving full backwards
   compatibility.

B.2.2.  Hybrid Extensions (Keys and Signatures)

   The use of Composite Crypto provides the possibility to process
   multiple algorithms without changing the logic of applications, but
   updating the cryptographic libraries: one-time change across the
   whole system.  However, when it is not possible to upgrade the crypto
   engines/libraries, it is possible to leverage X.509 extensions to
   encode the additional keys and signatures.  When the custom
   extensions are not marked critical, although this approach provides
   the most backward-compatible approach where clients can simply ignore
   the post-quantum (or extra) keys and signatures, it also requires all
   applications to be updated for correctly processing multiple
   algorithms together.

              Composite Signatures For Use In Internet PKI
                  draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs-09

Abstract

   The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history
   of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor
   the new incoming algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the
   required data lifetimes.  The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and
   elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptanalysis, while the incoming
   post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying
   mathematics as well as hardware and software implementations that
   have not had sufficient maturing time to rule out classical
   cryptanalytic attacks and implementation bugs.

   Cautious implementers may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such
   that an attacker would need to break all of them in order to
   compromise the data being protected using either a Post-Quantum /
   Traditional Hybrid, Post-Quantum / Post-Quantum Hybrid, or
   combinations thereof.  This document, and its companions, defines a
   specific instantiation of hybrid paradigm called "composite" where
   multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined to form a single key,
   signature, or key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) such that they can be
   treated as a single atomic object at the protocol level.

   This document defines the structures CompositeSignatureValue, and
   CompositeSignatureParams, which are sequences of the respective
   structure for each component algorithm.  The explicit variant is
   defined which allows for a set of signature algorithm identifier OIDs
   to be registered together as an explicit composite signature
   algorithm and assigned an OID.

   This document is intended to be coupled with corresponding documents
   that define the structure and semantics of composite public and
   private keys and encryption [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys],
   however may also be used with non-composite keys, such as when a
   protocol combines multiple certificates into a single cryptographic
   operation.

   *  Removed SPHINCS+ hybrids.

   *  Removed all references to generic composite.

   *  Added selection criteria note about requesting new explicit
      combinations.

2.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not
   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had
   sufficient scrutiny and time to discover and fix implementation bugs.
   Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm migrations, the choice of
   when to migrate and which algorithms to migrate to, is not so clear.
   Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an
   entity's cryptographic identity to be composed of multiple public-key
   algorithms.

   The deployment of composite signatures using post-quantum algorithms
   will face two challenges

   *  _Algorithm strength_ uncertainty: During the transition period,
      some post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be
      fully trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key
      algorithms will start to erode.  A relying party may learn some
      time after deployment that a public key algorithm has become
      untrustworthy, but in the interim, they may not know which
      algorithm an adversary has compromised.

   *  _Backwards compatibility_: During the transition period, post-
      quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.

   This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength
   uncertainty concerns by building on [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys]
   by providing formats for encoding multiple signature values into
   existing public signature fields, as well as the process for
   validating a composite signature.  Backwards compatibility is
   addressed via using composite in conjunction with a non-composite
   hybrid mode such as that described in
   [I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth].

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that
   digital signatures are used within PKIX and CMS structures.

2.1.  Algorithm Selection Criteria

   The composite algorithm combinations defined in this document were
   chosen according to the following guidelines:

   1.  A single RSA combination is provided (but RSA modulus size not
       mandated), matched with NIST PQC Level 3 algorithms.

   2.  Elliptic curve algorithms are provided with combinations on each
       of the NIST [RFC6090], Brainpool [RFC5639], and Edwards [RFC7748]
       curves.  NIST PQC Levels 1 - 3 algorithms are matched with
       256-bit curves, while NIST levels 4 - 5 are matched with 384-bit
       elliptic curves.  This provides a balance between matching
       classical security levels of post-quantum and traditional
       algorithms, and also selecting elliptic curves which already have
       wide adoption.

   3.  NIST level 1 candidates (Falcon512 and Kyber512) are provided,
       matched with 256-bit elliptic curves, intended for constrained
       use cases.  The authors wish to note that although all the
       composite structures defined in this and the companion documents
       [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys] and
       [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-kem] specifications are defined in
       such a way as to easily allow 3 or more component algorithms, it
       was decided to only specify explicit pairs.  This also does not
       preclude future specification of explicit combinations with three
       or more components.

   To maximize interoperability, use of the specific algorithm
   combinations specified in this document is encouraged.  If other
   combinations are needed, a separate specification should be submitted
   to the IETF LAMPS working group.  To ease implementation, these
   specifications are encouraged to follow the construction pattern of
   the algorithms specified in this document.

2.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   ALGORITHM: A standardized cryptographic primitive, as well as any
   ASN.1 structures needed for encoding data and metadata needed to use
   the algorithm.  This document is primarily concerned with algorithms
   for producing digital signatures.

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   CLIENT: Any software that is making use of a cryptographic key.  This
   includes a signer, verifier, encrypter, decrypter.

   COMPONENT ALGORITHM: A single basic algorithm which is contained
   within a composite algorithm.

   COMPOSITE ALGORITHM: An algorithm which is a sequence of two or more
   component algorithms, as defined in Section 3.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   LEGACY: For the purposes of this document, a legacy algorithm is any
   cryptographic algorithm currently is use which is not believe to be
   resistant to quantum cryptanalysis.

   PKI: Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in [RFC5280].

   POST-QUANTUM ALGORITHM: Any cryptographic algorithm which is believed
   to be resistant to classical and quantum cryptanalysis, such as the
   algorithms being considered for standardization by NIST.

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

   SIGNATURE: A digital cryptographic signature, making no assumptions
   about which algorithm.

   STRIPPING ATTACK: An attack in which the attacker is able to
   downgrade the cryptographic object to an attacker-chosen subset of
   original set of component algorithms in such a way that it is not
   detectable by the receiver.  For example, substituting a composite
   public key or signature for a version with fewer components.

3.  Composite Signature Structures

   In order for signatures to be composed of multiple algorithms, we
   define encodings consisting of a sequence of signature primitives
   (aka "component algorithms") such that these structures can be used
   as a drop-in replacement for existing signature fields such as those
   found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS
   [RFC5652].

3.1.  Composite Keys

   A composite signature MAY be associated with a composite public key
   as defined in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys], but MAY also be
   associated with multiple public keys from different sources, for
   example multiple X.509 certificates, or multiple cryptographic
   modules.  In the latter case, composite signatures MAY be used as the
   mechanism for carrying multiple signatures in a non-composite hybrid
   authentication mechanism such as those described in
   [I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth].

3.1.1.  Key Usage Bits

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, then the composite public key associated with a
   composite signature MUST have a signing-type key usage.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a Certification Authority
   (CA) certificate that indicates a composite key, then any combination
   of the following values MAY be present:

   digitalSignature;
   nonRepudiation;
   keyCertSign; and
   cRLSign.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an End Entity (EE)
   certificate that indicates a composite key, then any combination of
   the following values MAY be present:

   digitalSignature; and
   nonRepudiation;

3.2.  sa-CompositeSignature

   The ASN.1 algorithm object for a composite signature is:

   sa-CompositeSignature SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM ::= {
       IDENTIFIER TYPE OBJECT IDENTIFIER
       VALUE CompositeSignatureValue
       PARAMS ANY DEFINED BY ALGORITHM
       PUBLIC-KEYS { pk-Composite }
       SMIME-CAPS ANY DEFINED BY ALGORITHM }

   The following is an explanation how SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM elements are
   used to create Composite Signatures:

                                  Table 1

3.3.  CompositeSignatureValue

   The output of the composite signature algorithm is the DER encoding
   of the following structure:

   CompositeSignatureValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF BIT STRING

   Where each BIT STRING within the SEQUENCE is a signature value
   produced by one of the component keys.  It MUST contain one signature
   value produced by each component algorithm, and in the same order as
   in the associated CompositeSignatureParams object.

   A CompositeSignatureValue MUST contain the same number of component
   signatures as the corresponding public and private keys, and the
   order of component signature values MUST correspond to the component
   public keys.

   The choice of SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING, rather than for example a
   single BIT STRING containing the concatenated signature values, is to
   gracefully handle variable-length signature values by taking
   advantage of ASN.1's built-in length fields.

3.4.  CompositeSignatureParameters

   Composite signature parameters are defined as follows and MAY be used
   when a composite signature is used with an AlgorithmIdentifier:



Ounsworth, et al.       Expires 27 November 2023                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs                   May 2023


   CompositeSignatureParams ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF
        AlgorithmIdentifier{SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM, {SignatureAlgSet}}

   The signature's CompositeSignatureParams sequence MUST contain the
   same component algorithms listed in the same order as in the
   associated CompositePublicKey.

   For explicit algorithms, it is not strictly necessary to carry a
   CompositeSignatureParams with the list of component algorithms in the
   signature algorithm parameters because clients can infer the expected
   component algorithms from the algorithm identifier.  The PARAMS is
   left optional because some types of component algorithms will require
   parameters to be carried, such as RSASSA-PSS-params as defined in
   [RFC8017].  Section 3.2 defines PARAMS ANY DEFINED BY ALGORITHM so
   that explicit algorithms may define params as ABSENT, or use
   CompositeSignatureParams as defined in ASN.1 module.

3.5.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that composite signature
   data structures be represented by an octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

   In the interests of simplicity and avoiding compatibility issues,
   implementations that parse these structures MAY accept both BER and
   DER.

4.  Algorithm Identifiers

   This section defines the algorithm identifiers for explicit
   combinations.  For simplicity and prototyping purposes, the signature
   algorithm object identifiers specified in this document are the same
   as the composite key object Identifiers specified in {draft-
   ounsworth-pq-composite-keys}.  A proper implementation should not
   presume that the object ID of a composite key will be the same as its
   composite signature algorithm.

   This section is not intended to be exhaustive and other authors may
   define others composite signature algorithms so long as they are
   compatible with the structures and processes defined in this and
   companion public and private key documents.

   Some use-cases desire the flexibility for clients to use any
   combination of supported algorithms, while others desire the rigidity
   of explicitly-specified combinations of algorithms.

   The following table summarizes the details for each explicit
   composite signature algorithms:

   The OID referenced are TBD for prototyping only, and the following
   prefix is used for each:

   replace <CompSig> with the String "2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.1"

   Therefore <CompSig>.1 is equal to 2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.1.1

4.1.  Notes on id-Dilithium3-RSA-PSS

   Use of RSA-PSS [RFC8017] deserves a special explanation.

   When the id-Dilithium3-RSA-PSS object identifier is used with an
   AlgorithmIdentifier, the AlgorithmIdentifier.parameters MUST be of
   type `CompositeSignatureParams as follows:

   SEQUENCE {
       AlgorithmIdentifier {
           id-Dilithium3TBD
       },
       AlgorithmIdentifier {
           id-RSASSA-PSS,
           RSASSA-PSS-params
       }
   }

   EDNOTE: We probably should pick concrete crypto for the RSASSA-PSS-
   params.  Once the crypto is fixed, we could omit the parameters
   entirely and expect implementations to re-constitute the params
   structures as necessary in order to call into lower-level crypto
   libraries.

   TODO: there must be a way to put all this the ASN.1 Module rather
   than just specifying it as text?

5.  Composite Signature Processes

   This section specifies the processes for generating and verifying
   composite signatures.

   This process addresses algorithm strength uncertainty by providing
   the verifier with parallel signatures from all the component
   signature algorithms; thus forging the composite signature would
   require forging all of the component signatures.

5.1.  Composite Signature Generation Process

   Generation of a composite signature involves applying each component
   algorithm's signature process to the input message according to its
   specification, and then placing each component signature value into
   the CompositeSignatureValue structure defined in Section 3.2.

   The following process is used to generate composite signature values.

Input:
     K1, K2, .., Kn     Signing private keys. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     A1, A2, ... An     Component signature algorithms. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     M                  Message to be signed, an octet string

Output:
     S                  The signatures, a CompositeSignatureValue

Signature Generation Process:
   1. Generate the n component signatures independently,
      according to their algorithm specifications.

        for i := 1 to n
            Si := Sign( Ki, Ai, M )

   2. Encode each component signature S1, S2, .., Sn into a BIT STRING
      according to its algorithm specification.

        S ::= Sequence { S1, S2, .., Sn }

   3. Output S

   Note on composite inputs: the method of providing the list of
   component keys and algorithms is flexible and beyond the scope of
   this pseudo-code, for example they may be carried in
   CompositePrivateKey and CompositeSignatureParams structures.  It is
   also possible to generate a composite signature that combines
   signatures from distinct keys stored in separate software or hardware
   keystores.  Variations in the process to accommodate particular
   private key storage mechanisms are considered to be conformant to
   this document so long as it produces the same output as the process
   sketched above.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs                   May 2023


   Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed in
   [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys], no component signature may itself
   be a composite; ie the signature generation process MUST fail if one
   of the private keys K1, K2, .., Kn is a composite with the OID id-
   alg-composite or an explicit composite OID.

   A composite signature MUST produce, and include in the output, a
   signature value for every component key in and include in the output,
   a signature value for every component key in the corresponding
   CompositePublicKey, and they MUST be in the same order; ie in the
   output, S1 MUST correspond to K1, S2 to K2, etc.

5.2.  Composite Signature Verification Process

   Verification of a composite signature involves applying each
   component algorithm's verification process according to its
   specification.

   In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise,
   compliant applications MUST output "Valid signature" (true) if and
   only if all component signatures were successfully validated, and
   "Invalid signature" (false) otherwise.

   The following process is used to perform this verification.

  Input:
       P1, P2, .., Pn     Public verification keys. See note below on
                          composite inputs.

       M                  Message whose signature is to be verified,
                          an octet string

       S1, S2, .., Sn    Component signature values to be verified.
                         See note below on composite inputs.

       A1, A2, ... An     Component signature algorithms. See note
                          below on composite inputs.

  Output:
      Validity (bool)    "Valid signature" (true) if the composite
                          signature is valid, "Invalid signature"
                          (false) otherwise.

  Signature Verification Procedure::
     1. Check keys, signatures, and algorithms lists for consistency.

        If Error during Desequencing, or the three sequences have
        different numbers of elements, or any of the public keys
        P1, P2, .., Pn or algorithm identifiers A1, A2, .., An are
        composite with the OID id-alg-composite or an explicit composite
        OID then output "Invalid signature" and stop.

     2. Check each component signature individually, according to its
         algorithm specification.
         If any fail, then the entire signature validation fails.

       for i := 1 to n
            if not verify( Pi, M, Si, Ai ), then
              output "Invalid signature"

        if all succeeded, then
          output "Valid signature"

   Note on composite inputs: the method of providing the list of
   component keys, algorithms and signatures is flexible and beyond the
   scope of this pseudo-code, for example they may be carried in
   CompositePublicKey, CompositeSignatureParams, and
   compositesignaturevalue structures.  It is also possible to verify a
   composite signature where the component public verification keys
   belong, for example, to separate X.509 certificates or cryptographic
   modules.  Variations in the process to accommodate particular public
   verification key storage mechanisms are considered to be conformant
   to this document so long as it produces the same output as the
   process sketched above.

   Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed in
   [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys], no component signature may be
   composite; ie the signature verification procedure MUST fail if any
   of the public keys P1, P2, .., Pn or algorithm identifiers A1, A2,
   .., An are composite with OID id-alg-composite or an explicit
   composite OID.

   Some verification clients may include a policy mechanism for
   specifying acceptable subsets of algorithms.  In these cases,
   implementer MAY, in the interest of performance of compatibility,
   modify the above process to skip one or more signature validations as
   per their local client policy.  See
   [I-D.pala-klaussner-composite-kofn] for a discussion of
   implementation and associated risks.

8.1.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), then clients performing
   signatures or verifications should be updated to adhere to
   appropriate policies.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since a single public
   key, certificate, or signature may contain a mixture of deprecated
   and non-deprecated algorithms.  Moreover, implementers may decide
   that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary security
   properties and are acceptable in combination even though neither
   algorithm is acceptable by itself.

   Specifying a modified verification algorithm to handle these
   situations is beyond the scope of this draft, but could be desirable
   as the subject of an application profile document, or to be up to the
   discretion of implementers.

   2. Check policy to see whether A1, A2, ..., An constitutes a valid
      combination of algorithms.

      if not checkPolicy(A1, A2, ..., An), then
        output "Invalid signature"

Appendix A.  Work in Progress

A.1.  Combiner modes (KofN)

   For content commitment use-cases, such as legally-binding non-
   repudiation, the signer (whether it be a CA or an end entity) needs
   to be able to specify how its signature is to be interpreted and
   verified.

   For now we have removed combiner modes (AND, OR, KofN) from this
   draft, but we are still discussing how to incorporate this for the
   cases where it is needed (maybe a X.509 v3 extension, or a signature
   algorithm param).

Appendix B.  Samples

B.1.  Explicit Composite Signature Examples

   TODO

Appendix C.  Implementation Considerations

   This section addresses practical issues of how this draft affects
   other protocols and standards.

C.1.  Backwards Compatibility

   The term "backwards compatibility" is used here to mean something
   more specific; that existing systems as they are deployed today can
   interoperate with the upgraded systems of the future.  This draft
   explicitly does not provide backwards compatibilitym, only upgraded
   systems will understand the OIDs defined in this document.

   If backwards compatibility is required, then additional mechanisms
   will be needed.  Migration and interoperability concerns need to be
   thought about in the context of various types of protocols that make
   use of X.509 and PKIX with relation to digital signature objects,
   from online negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and IKEv2
   [RFC7296], to non-negotiated asynchronous protocols such as S/MIME
   signed email [RFC8551], document signing such as in the context of
   the European eIDAS regulations [eIDAS2014], and publicly trusted code
   signing [codeSigningBRsv2.8], as well as myriad other standardized
   and proprietary protocols and applications that leverage CMS
   [RFC5652] signed structures.  Composite simplifies the protocol
   design work because it can be implemented as a signature algorithm
   that fits into existing systems.

C.1.1.  Parallel PKIs

   We present the term "Parallel PKI" to refer to the setup where a PKI
   end entity possesses two or more distinct public keys or certificates
   for the same identity (name), but containing keys for different
   cryptographic algorithms.  One could imagine a set of parallel PKIs
   where an existing PKI using legacy algorithms (RSA, ECC) is left
   operational during the post-quantum migration but is shadowed by one
   or more parallel PKIs using pure post quantum algorithms or composite
   algorithms (legacy and post-quantum).

   Equipped with a set of parallel public keys in this way, a client
   would have the flexibility to choose which public key(s) or
   certificate(s) to use in a given signature operation.

   For negotiated protocols, the client could choose which public key(s)
   or certificate(s) to use based on the negotiated algorithms, or could
   combine two of the public keys for example in a non-composite hybrid
   method such as [I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth] or
   [I-D.guthrie-ipsecme-ikev2-hybrid-auth].  Note that it is possible to
   use the signature algorithms defined in Section 4 as a way to carry
   the multiple signature values generated by one of the non-composite
   public mechanism in protocols where it is easier to support the
   composite signature algorithms than to implement such a mechanism in
   the protocol itself.  There is also nothing precluding a composite
   public key from being one of the components used within a non-
   composite authentication operation; this may lead to greater
   convenience in setting up parallel PKI hierarchies that need to
   service a range of clients implementing different styles of post-
   quantum migration strategies.

   For non-negotiated protocols, the details for obtaining backwards
   compatibility will vary by protocol, but for example in CMS
   [RFC5652], the inclusion of multiple SignerInfo objects is often
   already treated as an OR relationship, so including one for each of
   the signer's parallel PKI public keys would, in many cases, have the
   desired effect of allowing the receiver to choose one they are
   compatible with and ignore the others, thus achieving full backwards
   compatibility.

C.1.2.  Hybrid Extensions (Keys and Signatures)

   The use of Composite Crypto provides the possibility to process
   multiple algorithms without changing the logic of applications, but
   updating the cryptographic libraries: one-time change across the
   whole system.  However, when it is not possible to upgrade the crypto
   engines/libraries, it is possible to leverage X.509 extensions to
   encode the additional keys and signatures.  When the custom
   extensions are not marked critical, although this approach provides
   the most backward-compatible approach where clients can simply ignore
   the post-quantum (or extra) keys and signatures, it also requires all
   applications to be updated for correctly processing multiple
   algorithms together.

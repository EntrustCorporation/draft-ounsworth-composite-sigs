              Composite Signatures For Use In Internet PKI
                  draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs-06

Abstract

   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
   the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different
   cryptographic algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual
   post-quantum algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic
   operation will need to be performed in such a way that breaking it
   requires breaking each of the component algorithms individually.
   This requires defining new structures for holding composite signature
   data.

   This document defines the structures CompositeSignatureValue, and
   CompositeParams, which are sequences of the respective structure for
   each component algorithm.  This document also defines processes for
   generating and verifying composite signatures.  This document makes
   no assumptions about what the component algorithms are, provided that
   their algorithm identifiers and signature generation and verification
   processes are defined.

1.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not
   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had
   sufficient scrutiny.  Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm
   migrations, the choice of when to migrate and which algorithms to
   migrate to, is not so clear.  Even after the migration period, it may
   be advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to be composed
   of multiple public-key algorithms.

   The deployment of composite signatures using post-quantum algorithms
   will face two challenges

   o  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   o  Backwards compatibility: During the transition period, post-
      quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.

   This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength
   uncertainty by building on ~~ reference draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-
   pubkeys ~~ by providing formats for encoding multiple signature
   values into existing public signature fields, as well as the process
   for validating a composite signature.  Backwards compatibility is
   addressed via the Composite-OR mechanism described herein.

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that
   digital signatures are used within PKIX and CMS structures.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   ALGORITHM: An information object class for identifying the type of
   cryptographic operation to be performed.  This document is primarily
   concerned with algorithms for producing digital signatures.

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   COMPONENT ALGORITHM: A single basic algorithm which is contained
   within a composite algorithm.

   COMPOSITE ALGORITHM: An algorithm which is a sequence of two or more
   component algorithms, as defined in Section 2.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   LEGACY: For the purposes of this document, a legacy key or signature
   is a non-composite key or signature.

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

   SIGNATURE: A digital cryptographic signature, making no assumptions
   about which algorithm.

2.  Composite Identifiers and Structures

   In order for signatures to be composed of multiple algorithms, we
   define encodings consisting of a sequence of signature primitives
   (aka "component algorithms") such that these structures can be used
   as a drop-in replacement for existing signature fields such as those
   found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS
   [RFC5652].

   This section defines the following structures:

   o  The id-alg-composite is an AlgorithmIdentifier identifying a
      composite signature object.

      The sa-CompositeSignature AlgorithmIdentifier and the
      corresponding CompositeParams identify the algorithm(s) used in a
      composite signature.

   o  The CompositeSignatureValue, carries a sequence of signatures that
      are generated by a CompositePrivateKey, and can be verified with
      the corresponding CompositePublicKey.

   EDNOTE 2: the choice to define composite algorithm parameters as a
   sequence inside the existing fields avoids the exponential
   proliferation of OIDs that are needed for each combination of

   signature algorithms in other schemes for achieving multi-key
   certificates.  This scheme also naturally extends from 2-keypair to
   n-keypair keys and certificates.

   EDNOTE 2a: We have heard community feedback that the ASN.1 structures
   presented here are too flexible in that allow arbitrary combinations
   of an arbitrary number of signature algorithms.  The feedback is that
   this is too much of a "footgun" for implementors and sysadmins.  We
   are working on an alternative formulation using ASN.1 information
   object classes that allow for compiling explicit pairs of
   algorithmIDs.  We would love community feedback on which approach is
   preferred.  See slide 30 of this presentation:
   https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2021-lamps-01/materials/
   slides-interim-2021-lamps-01-sessa-position-presentation-by-mike-
   ounsworth-00.pdf

2.1.  Algorithm Identifier

   The following object identifier is used for identifying a composite
   signature.  Additional encoding information is provided below for
   each of these objects.

   id-alg-composite OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       iso(1)  identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4)
       enterprise(1) OpenCA(18227) Algorithms(2) id-alg-composite(1) }

   EDNOTE 3: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping.
   We are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see Section 5.

2.2.  Composite Keys

   A Composite signature MUST be associated with a Composite public key
   as defined in ~~ reference draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-pubkey ~~.

2.2.1.  Key Usage Bits

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, then the composite public key associated with a
   composite signature MUST have a signing-type key usage.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a Certification Authority
   (CA) certificate that indicates id-composite-key, then any
   combination of the following values MAY be present:

   digitalSignature;
   nonRepudiation;
   keyCertSign; and
   cRLSign.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an End Entity (EE)
   certificate that indicates id-composite-key, then any combination of
   the following values MAY be present:

   digitalSignature; and
   nonRepudiation;

2.3.  Composite Signature

   The ASN.1 algorithm object for a composite signature is:

   sa-CompositeSignature SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM ::= {
       IDENTIFIER id-alg-composite
       VALUE CompositeSignatureValue
       PARAMS TYPE CompositeParams ARE required
       PUBLIC-KEYS { pk-Composite }
       SMIME-CAPS { IDENTIFIED BY id-alg-composite } }
   }

   The following algorithm parameters MUST be included:

   CompositeParams ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF AlgorithmIdentifier

   The signature's CompositeParams sequence MUST contain the same
   component algorithms listed in the same order as in the associated
   CompositePrivateKey and CompositePublicKey.

   The output of the composite signature algorithm is the DER encoding
   of the following structure:

   CompositeSignatureValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF BIT STRING

   Where each BIT STRING within the SEQUENCE is a signature value
   produced by one of the component keys.  It MUST contain one signature
   value produced by each component algorithm, and in the same order as
   in the associated CompositeParams object.

   The choice of "SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING", rather than for example a
   single BIT STRING containing the concatenated signature values, is to
   gracefully handle variable-length signature values by taking
   advantage of ASN.1's built-in length fields.

2.4.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that composite signature
   data structures be represented by an octet string or bit string.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs              February 2022


   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

   In the interests of simplicity and avoiding compatibility issues,
   implementations that parse these structures MAY accept both BER and
   DER.

3.  Composite Signature Processes

   This section specifies the processes for generating and verifying
   composite signatures.

   This process addresses algorithm strength uncertainty by providing
   the verifier with parallel signatures from all the component
   signature algorithms; thus breaking the composite signature would
   require breaking all of the component signatures.

3.1.  Composite Signature Generation Process

   Generation of a composite signature involves applying each component
   algorithm's signature process to the input message according to its
   specification, and then placing each component signature value into
   the CompositeSignatureValue structure defined in Section 2.3.

   The following process is used to generate composite signature values.

  Input:
       K1, K2, .., Kn     Private keys for the n component signature
                          algorithms, a CompositePrivateKey
       M                  Message to be signed, an octet string

  Output:
       S                  The signatures, a CompositeSignatureValue

  Signature Generation Process:
     1. Generate the n component signatures independently,
        according to their algorithm specifications.

          for i := 1 to n
              Si := Sign( Ki, M )

     2. Encode each component signature S1, S2, .., Sn into a BIT STRING
        according to its algorithm specification.

          S ::= Sequence { S1, S2, .., Sn }

     3. Output S

   Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed in ~~ Reference
   draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-pubkeys sec-composite-pub-keys ~~, no
   component signature may itself be a composite; ie the signature
   generation process MUST fail if one of the private keys K1, K2, ..,
   Kn is a composite with the OID id-alg-composite.

   A composite signature MUST produce and include in the output a
   signature value for every component key in the corresponding
   CompositePrivateKey.  For this mode, please see Composite-OR in
   section Section 3.2.

3.2.  Composite-OR Signature Generation Process

   EDNOTE: This section was written with the intention of keeping the
   primary Composite OID reserved for the simple and strict mode; if you
   want to do either a simple OR, or a custom policy then we have given
   a different OID.  We are still debating whether this is useful to
   specify at issuing time, or whether this is adding needless
   complexity to the draft.

   If the algorithm ID of the public key associated with this signature
   is id-composite-or-key then the signer MAY use only a subset of the
   component keys and therefore produce fewer signatures than the number
   of component keys.

   Composite-OR signature generation uses the same structures and
   algorithms as Composite, with the difference that the signature
   generation process may emit a null instead of a signature value in
   step 1 for one or more component algorithms.  A Composite-OR
   signature MUST NOT be entirely null; it must contain at least one
   valid signature.

   The design intent of this mode is to support migration scenarios
   where an end entity has been issued keys on algorithms that either
   itself or the peer with which it is communicating do not (yet)
   support.  This design allows for both the mode where the signer omits
   signatures that it knows its peer cannot process in order to save
   bandwidth and performance, and the mode where it includes all
   component signatures and allows the verifier to choose how many to
   verify.  The latter is RECOMMENDED for signatures that need both
   sort-term backwards compatibility as well as long-term security.

   EDNOTE: Do we want to allow a Composite-OR with only a single
   signature to produce non-composite signatureAlgorithm and
   signatureValua as per [RFC5280]?  Advantages: bandwidth savings of an
   extra OID and some sequences with one element.  Disadvantages:
   ambiguous whether a signature is traditional or composite until you
   look at the corresponding public key.

3.3.  Composite Signature Verification Process

   Verification of a composite signature involves applying each
   component algorithm's verification process according to its
   specification.

   In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise,
   compliant applications MUST output "Valid signature" (true) if and
   only if all component signatures were successfully validated, and
   "Invalid signature" (false) otherwise.

   The following process is used to perform this verification.

Input:
     P    Signer's composite public key
     M    Message whose signature is to be verified, an octet string
     S    Composite Signature to be verified
     A    Composite Algorithm identifier

Output:
    Validity      "Valid signature" (true) if the composite signature
                  is valid, "Invalid signature" (false) otherwise.

Signature Verification Procedure::
   1. Parse P, S, A into the component public keys, signatures,
      and algorithm identifiers

      P1, P2, .., Pn := Desequence( P )
      S1, S2, .., Sn := Desequence( S )
      A1, A2, .., An := Desequence( A )

    If Error during Desequencing, or the three sequences have
    different numbers of elements, or any of the public keys P1, P2, .., Pn or
    algorithm identifiers A1, A2, .., An are composite with the OID
    id-alg-composite then output "Invalid signature" and stop.

   2. Check each component signature individually, according to its
       algorithm specification.
       If any fail, then the entire signature validation fails.

     for i := 1 to n
          if not verify( Pi, M, Si ), then
            output "Invalid signature"

      if all succeeded, then
        output "Valid signature"

   Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed in ~~ Reference
   draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys sec-composite-pub-keys ~~, no
   component signature may be composite; ie the signature verification
   procedure MUST fail if any of the public keys P1, P2, .., Pn or
   algorithm identifiers A1, A2, .., An are composite with the OID id-
   alg-composite.

3.4.  Composite-OR Signature Verification

   EDNOTE: This section was written with the intention of keeping the
   primary Composite OID reserved for the simple and strict mode; if you
   want to do either a simple OR, or a custom policy then we have given
   a different OID.  We are still debating whether this is useful to

   specify at issuing time, or whether this is adding needless
   complexity to the draft.

   When the public key associated with the signature being verified has
   algorithm id-composite-or-key, then an alternate verification
   processes MAY be used, at the discretion of the implementor.  In this
   section we provide some examples of alternate verification processes.

   If the signature is a traditional (non-composite) algorithm and value
   or a composite signature with a single component, then it MAY be
   considered valid if it verifies under one of the component keys.

   If the signature is composite, then the implementor MAY implement
   policy for which combinations are acceptable.

   EDNOTE: Does this mean Composite-OR end entity certificates need to
   be issued by a PKI that is marked as Composite-OR all the way to the
   top so that verifiers that do not support all the algorithms don't
   fail?  Need to think more about the security implications of allowing
   a Composite-or in an end entity cert implicitely turning all
   Composite algIDs into Composite-or algIDs in its cert chain.

   EDNOTE: Do we need to specify the semantics of verifying an "n of m"
   subset signature?  I suspect that specifying this in general will be
   a rat's nest of edge cases, so I propose to "leave this to the
   implementor".

3.4.1.  Composite-OR Legacy Mode

   The Composite-OR Legacy Mode is provided to facilitate migration by
   allowing existing PKI entities (including root CAs, intermediate CAs,
   and end entities) to have their existing keys re-certified inside a
   Composite-OR structure along with Post-Quantum keys, and for
   signatures made by that key prior to the migration to remain valid.
   Note that Composite-OR Legacy Mode is only provided for signature
   verification, and not for signature generation; legacy signatures
   SHOULD NOT be produced from a Composite key.

   EDNOTE: to further solidify this, we could add a clause that Legacy
   Mode signatures are to fail if the signature was produced after
   notBefore date of the Composite-OR certificate?

   In Composite-OR Legacy Mode, a legacy signature algorithm and legacy
   signature value MAY be validated against a Composite-OR public key.
   The legacy signature algorithm is to be interpreted by the verifier
   as a sa-CompositeSignature with CompositeParams in the following way:

   CompositeParams {legacyAlgorithmIdentifier, null, .., null}



Ounsworth & Pala         Expires August 12, 2022               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Sigs              February 2022


   with the correct number of nulls to match the Composite-OR public key
   that the signature is being verified against.  For the purposes of a
   signature validation under Composite-OR Legacy Mode, a null
   AlgorithmIdentifier is considered to be a match for the corresponding
   algorithm in the Composite-OR public key.

   The legacy signature value is to be interpreted by the verifier as a
   sa-CompositeSignature with CompositeParams in the following way:

   CompositeSignatureValue  {legacySignatureValue, null, .., null}

   with the correct number of nulls to match the Composite-OR public key
   that the signature is being verified against.  The verification
   algorithm in section Section 3.4 applies.

   Security consideration: when implementing Composite-OR Legacy Mode,
   it is important to catch the edge case of {null, null, .., null} for
   both AlgorithmIdentifier and SignatureValue and return Invalid
   Signature.

   It is RECOMMENDED that Composite-OR Legacy Mode be implemented as an
   optional mode in the verifier that can be enabled or disabled by
   runtime configuration or policy.

   EDNOTE: the signing public key is often identified in the signed
   document by issuer+serialNumber or by an SKI containing a hash of the
   public key value.  Might need X.509 extensions identifying the SKI of
   the legacy cert it's replacing?

4.  In Practice

   other protocols and standards.

   o  If a cert in the chain is a composite cert then does the whole
      chain need to be of composite Certs?

   o  We could also explain that the root CA cert does not have to be of
      the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be transferred in

      the authentication exchange to save transport overhead and thus it
      can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.

   o  We could talk about overhead (size and processing).

   o  We could also discuss backwards compatibility.

   o  We could include a subsection about implementation considerations.

4.1.  Cryptographic protocols

   This section talks about how protocols like (D)TLS and IKEv2 are
   affected by this specifications.  It will not attempt to solve all
   these problems, but it will explain the rationale, how things will
   work and what open problems need to be solved.  Obvious issues that
   need to be discussed.

   o  How does the protocol declare support for composite signatures?
      TLS has hooks for declaring support for specific signature
      algorithms, however it would need to be extended, because the
      client would need to declare support for both the composite
      infrastructure, as well as for the various component signature
      algorithms.

   o  How does the protocol use the multiple keys.  The obvious way
      would be to have the server sign using its composite public key;
      is this sufficient.

   o  Overhead; including certificate size, signature processing time,
      and size of the signature.

   o  How to deal with crypto protocols that use public key encryption
      algorithms; this document only lists how to work with signature
      algorithms.  Encoding composite public keys is straightforward;
      encoding composite ciphertexts is less so - we decided to put that
      off to another draft.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The ASN.1 module OID is TBD.  The id-alg-composite OID is to be
   assigned by IANA.  The authors suggest that IANA assign an OID on the
   id-pkix arc:

   id-alg-composite OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
       mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6) composite(??) }

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), it is obvious that
   structures using that algorithm are implicitly revoked.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since a single public
   key, certificate, or signature may contain a mixture of deprecated
   and non-deprecated algorithms.  Moreover, implementers may decide
   that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary security
   properties and are acceptable in combination even though neither
   algorithm is acceptable by itself.

   Specifying a modified verification algorithm to handle these
   situations is beyond the scope of this draft, but could be desirable
   as the subject of an application profile document, or to be up to the
   discretion of implementers.

   2. Check policy to see whether A1, A2, ..., An constitutes a valid
      combination of algorithms.

      if not checkPolicy(A1, A2, ..., An), then
        output "Invalid signature"

   While intentionally not specified in this document, implementors
   should put careful thought into implementing a meaningfull policy
   mechinism within the context of their signature verification engines,
   for example only algorithms that provide similar security levels
   should be combined together.

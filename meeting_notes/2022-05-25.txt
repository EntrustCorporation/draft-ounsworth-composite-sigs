Since last time, I have:

- Removed AND, OR, KofN from -keys

- Largely removed them from -sigs, except for a MAY paragraph at the bottom of "4.2. Composite Signature Verification Process" 
    ... which Panos still had comments about, so we should review.
- Written an Implementation Consideration > Backwards Compatibility
- Addressed Carl Wallace's comments (we can go through them)



Discussions:

There are two types of signatures: 1) authentication, and 2) content commitment. Examples of content commitment:

- Non-repudiation (the signer is declaring something legally-binding in the signed document)
- CRLsign (the CA is declaring some certificates to be revoked)

For content commitment cases, the signer will care if they are held accountable if their signature is forgeable.


Thought experiment: composite signature: {rsa, dilithium, rainbow}

now we know that rainbow is busted (forgeable). Question: does that raise repudiation concerns? IE can an attacker make 
it look like the signer signed something that in fact they did not? Comparing AND vs 2of3


How do acheive KofN for non-repudiation cases:

Define a signature algorithm (ex.: "sa-rsa-pss-sphincs-kofn{2}" ) that uses the public "key key-rsa-sphincs"

DECISIONS:
- Add a "Future Works" type secion to the draft saying that we are still working on this.

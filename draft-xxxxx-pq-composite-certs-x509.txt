1.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not
   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had
   sufficient scrutiny.  Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm

   migrations, the choice of when to migrate and which algorithms to
   migrate to, is not so clear.  Even after the migration period it may
   be advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to be composed
   of multiple public-key algorithms.  Even after the transition period,
   a composite approach may be advantageous as a single entity may have
   multiple public keys on different algorithms or strengths to address
   different use-cases, and a single signature may want to compase
   multiple of them together.

   The deployment of composite public keys and signatures using post-
   quantum algorithms will face two challenges

   o  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      also start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   o  Backwards compatibility: During the transition period, post-
      quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.

   This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength
   uncertainty by providing formats for encoding multiple public keys
   and multiple signature values into existing public key and signature
   fields.  The issue of backwards compatibility is left open to be
   addressed in separate draft(s).

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that
   public key structures or digital signatures are used, but where
   specific design decisions needed to be made, the authors chose the
   variant that caused the least disruption to existing X.509
   certificates, as defined in [RFC5280].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

3.1.  Definitions

   EDNOTE: A glossary of terms we define for this document, or terms
   that we borrow from other RFCs.

ALGORITHM: <!-- Borrowed straight from RFC2986 -->
            ENDOTE: need to clean up the link to "ITU-T Recommendation
            X.681 (1997)" ([11])
            An information object class defined in X.509 to
                   describe objects composed of an algorithm (a unique
                   object identifier) and its parameters (any ASN.1
                   type).  The values of objects in this class can be
                   represented by the ASN.1 type AlgorithmIdentifier{}.
                   ALGORITHM is defined as the "useful" information
                   object class TYPE-IDENTIFIER, specified in [11],
                   Annex A. This document is only concerned with
                   algorithms for producing digital signatures.

COMPONENT ALGORITHM:  A single basic algorithm which is contained
                      within a composite algorithm.

COMPOSITE ALGORITHM:  An algorithm which is a sequence of one or
                      more basic algorithm, as defined in section {{sec-composite-structs}}.

3.2.  Notation

   No special notation is used in this document.

4.  Composite Structures

   In order for public keys and signatures to be composed of multiple
   algorithms, the respective structures defined in [RFC2986], [RFC5280]
   (AND OTHERS??) need to be extended.  We define encodings of sequences
   of public keys and signature data which consist of a sequence of
   public keys and signatures from more basic signature algorithms (aka
   "component algorithms") such that these structures can be places into
   any existing public key or signature structure.

   This section defines

   o  Composite public key: A general structure for holding multiple
      public keys within a single public key data structure.

   o  Composite signature: Data structures needed to make use of the
      Composite Signature signature algorithm (defined in Section 6),
      which encapsulates signatures made with multiple public keys.

Internet-Draft               Composite Certs               February 2019


4.1.  Composite Public Key

   A composite public key is a sequence of component public keys that
   are used together.  A composite public key is identified by the
   object identifier

   id-ce-compositePublicKey OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { OID }

   The parameters field for this public key type MUST be absent.  The
   composite public key data is represented by the following structure:

   CompositePublicKey ::= SEQUENCE OF SubjectPublicKeyInfo

   where each element of the sequence is a SubjectPublicKeyInfo of a
   public key that MAY be used in conjunction with the other keys in the
   sequence.  When the public key must be provided in octet string or
   bit string format, the data structure is converted as specified in
   Section 5.

4.2.  Composite Signature Algorithm

   The Composite Signature signature algorithm defined in Section 6 is
   identified by the following object identifier:

   id-ce-compositeSignature OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { OID }

   The following algorithm parameters MUST be included when this
   identifier is used:

   CompositeSignatureAlgorithmParams ::= SEQUENCE OF AlgorithmIdentifier

   The algorithms in the sequence MUST correspond to the order in which
   the public keys are listed in the associated CompositePublicKey.

   EDNOTE: We haven't defined the private key syntax, should we?  SRF:
   My opinion: no, as private keys do not appear within the certificate.

   The Composite Signature algorithm output is the DER encoding of the
   following structure:

   id-ce-CompositeSignatureValue OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { OID }

   CompositeSignatureValue ::= SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING

   Where each bit string within CompositeSignatureValue is a signature
   by one of the component signature algorithms.  The choice of
   "SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING" rather than "BIT STRING" is so the type-
   length-value encoding can solve the problem of variable-length

   signature values.  The signature values in the sequence MUST
   correspond to the order in which the signature algorithms are listed
   in the corresponding CompositeSignatureAlgorithmParams, and in which
   the public keys are listed in the associated CompositePublicKey.

   Defining composite algorithm parameters as above avoids the
   exponential proliferation of OIDs needed for each pairwise
   combination of signature algorithms.  This scheme also naturally
   extends from 2-keypair to n-keypair should a vendor find a need for
   this.

5.  Encoding Composite Structures As Octet Strings and Bit Strings

   EDNOTE: Examples of how other specifications specify how a data
   structure is converted to a bit string can be found in RFC 2313,
   section 10.1.4, 3279 section 2.3.5, and RFC 4055, section 3.2.

   Many specifications require that the composite public key and
   composite signature data structures defined above be represented by
   an octet string or bit string.  When an octet string is required, the
   DER encoding of the composite data structure SHALL be used directly.
   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

6.  Composite Signature Algorithm

   The Composite Signature signature algorithm produces a single
   composite signature by applying multiple signature algorithms to the
   input message, using multiple private keys, with the resulting
   signature effectively being the concatenation of the individual
   signatures.  This algorithm can address algorithm strength
   uncertainty by providing the verifier with parallel signatures from
   all the component signature algorithms used as part of the composite
   signature.

 Input:
      K1, K2, ..., Kn    The n private keys for the component signature
                         algorithms
      M                  Message to be signed, an octet string

 Output:
      S                  Signature, an octet string

 Signature Generation Procedure::
    1.  Sign the message separately using each component
        for i := 1 to n
            Si := Sign( Ki, M )
    2.  Encode the component signatures into an ASN.1 value of type
         Signature with the DER, where the type Signature has the syntax
        Signature ::= Sequence { S1, S2, ..., Sn }
      Let S be the DER encoding of the Signature
    3.  Output S

6.2.  Composite Signature Verification

   This section provide a sample algorithm for validating composite
   signatures.  Compliant implementations MUST return "Invalid
   signature" whenever the sample algorithm does, but MAY require more
   than one signature to be valid.  Implementations MAY include
   additional policy mechanisms for determining which and how many
   algorithms must pass in order for the signature as a whole to be
   considered valid.  See section Section 7 for further discussion.

   This section assumes the existence of a policy mechanism to revoke
   individual component algorithms.  See section Section 7 for further
   discussion.

   EDNOTE: The corresponding "encrypt with a composite public key" logic
   is somewhat less obvious; a naive implementer might be tempted to
   encrypt the message with each public key separately, which is wrong.
   Specifying the correct implementation of such an encryption scheme is
   out of scope for this document, but would be good work for someone in
   the standards community to pick up.

Input:
     P    Signer's composite public key
     M    Message whose signature is to be verified, an octet string
     S    Composite Signature to be verified
     A    Composite Algorithm identifier

Output:
    Validity      "Valid signature" (true) if the composite signature is
                  valid, "Invalid signature" (false) otherwise.

Signature Verification Procedure::
   1. Parse P, S, A into the component public keys, signatures,
      algorithm identifiers
     P1, P2, ..., Pk := Desequence( P )
     S1, S2, ..., Sk := Desequence( S )
     A1, A2, ..., Ak := Desequence( A )

    If Error during Desequencing, or the three sequences had different
    numbers of elements, then output "Invalid signature" and stop.

   2. Check each signature individually
     for i := 1 to k
        Check if Ai is a recognized algorithm,  if so then,
          Check if algorithm Ai has been revoked, if not then,
             if verify( Pi, M, Si ), then output "Valid signature"
                 and stop.
             else output "Invalid signature" and stop.

    3. Output "Invalid signature" (as no nonrevoked signature
       algorithms were available).

7.  Mechanisms to distribute verification policy to clients

   In the traditional world where public keys and signature comprise a
   single algorithm, the semantics of a signature and a verification are
   straight-forward: if the key is trusted (via public key pinning, a
   PKIX revocation check, etc) and the signature is valid, then the
   signed content can be trusted.  However the semantics are less
   obvious in a world where public keys and signatures are composed of
   two or more algorithms; it is conceivable that even though a
   cryptographic algorithm is deprecated, a multi-algorithm signature
   may contain enough other trustworthy component algorithms to still be
   considered valid.

   In this section addresses policy surrounding which and how many
   component algorithms must be valid in order for the signature as a
   whole to be valid.  The authors ask for community feedback about
   whether how best to implement this, for example should it be

   specified by the signer at signing time, specified by an
   administrative authority such as a Certificate Authority, or left up
   to local policy of the verifier much as we do today?  The authors
   believe that by specifying such a mechanism, the world will be able
   to more quickly react to news of algorithm compromise with a lower
   service disruption compared to the need to revoke and re-issue all
   certificates using that algorithm.  However, we are not sure if the
   gains justify the added complexity.

   We list here several such mechanisms that have come up in discussion,
   mainly focused around X.509 PKIs, provided here for the purposes of
   sparking debate.

7.1.  Local verifier policy

   Much as we do today, this is left up to domain administrators and
   software vendors to implement the guidance of governing bodies on a
   system-by-system basis.

7.2.  Extra metadata in the signature

   This policy information could be included in the signature structure,
   allowing the signer to specify it at signing time.

7.3.  Extra metadata in the certificate

   This policy information could be included in a certificate via an
   X.509 v3 extension.  This gives the Certificate Authority control,
   but has the drawback that updating the policy requires revoking and
   reissuing certificates.

7.4.  Policy certificate issued by the Certificate Authority

   Certificate Authorities have the ability to issue policy certificates
   that specify the behaviour when verifying signatures performed by
   keys in certificates within the scope of the policy certificate.

   This method has the advantage that policy is centrally-managed, and
   can be updated without needing to reissue any certificates, but has
   the drawback that not all PKI implementations support policy
   certificates.

7.5.  Policy constraints in a cross-certificate

   This method behaves similarly to the policy certificate method above,
   but has better support across PKI implementations.

Internet-Draft               Composite Certs               February 2019


7.6.  Revoked Algorithms CRL Extension

   Add an extension to CRLs so that in addition to revoking
   certificates, they can also revoke algorithms for all certificates
   within the scope of that CRL.  Implemented with care, this could
   allow a single PKI to do a staged algorithm migration by only
   revoking the algorithm for one CRL group at a time.

   id-ce-RevokedAlgorithms OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { OID }

   RevokedAlgorithms ::= SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE  {
        algorithms              AlgorithmIdentifier,
        revocationDate          Time,
        crlEntryExtensions      Extensions OPTIONAL
                                 -- if present, version MUST be v2
        }

   EDNOTE: do we need the crlEntryExtensions field?  If so, which ones
   from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-5.3 are allowed
   here?

   There may only be one "RevokedAlgorithms" extension in a CRL.  This
   extension is OPTIONAL.  If a CRL contains only composite
   certificates, then this extension SHOULD be designated as critical.
   If a CRL contains a mixture of composite and traditional certificates
   then it SHOULD be designated as non-critical.

   If the Revoked Algorithms extension is present in the CRL covering an
   otherwise non-revoked certificate, then a client performing
   certificate validation MUST skip any signatures corresponding to a
   revoked algorithm; thus a certificate is valid only if it would have
   been valid had those Algorithm IDs and Signature Values been omitted
   from the certificate.

   EDNOTE: I feel like the wording above can be tightened up to be more
   precise.

   Once a algorithm has been marked as revoked on a given CRL, it MUST
   remain revoked on subsequent CRLs.  EDNOTE: ^^^ Is there
   corresponding wording about cert serial numbers on CRLs from RFC5280?
   If so, I'm not seeing it.

   Note that a similar mechanism could be used on a per-certificate
   basis via CRL Entry Extensions, however the authors believe that
   giving operators the ability to perform partial revocation of a
   certificate (ie revoking some keys or signatures but leaving the
   certificate as a whole valid) will greatly increase the complexity of
   certificate validation routines, thus increasing the chance of both

   human error, and implementation bugs leading to vulnerabilities,
   without providing a commensurate amount of increased functionality.
   By not defining a new CRL Entry Extension, the following requirement
   is implied: if any key within a certificate warrant revocation, the
   entire certificate MUST be revoked using the existing revocation
   mechanisms (this does not apply when the algorithm is globally
   revoked for the entire scope of this CRL).

7.7.  Implicit Revocation

   A Composite Signature Algorithm is considered to be "implicitly
   revoked" if one of the following conditions are met, but the
   certificate is otherwise valid.

   o  A certificate using a single-key algorithm which is revoked within
      the scope of its CRL.  In this case, signature verification SHOULD
      fail when performed by a compliant client, but of course will
      succeed when performed by a legacy client which is not aware of
      this CRL extension.

   o  All of the component algorithms are revoked within the scope if
      its CRL.  In this case, signature verification MUST fail when
      performed by a compliant client, regardless of which verification
      algorithm is used.

   At the time of an algorithm revocation, a certificate authority MAY
   revoke certificates meeting one ofd the above criteria (by placing
   them in the traditional "revokedCertificates" list) with a revocation
   reason of "keyCompromise".  OCSP responders SHOULD designate a
   certificate as revoked if it meets the above condition.

   EDNOTE: read up on how OCSP works and mention the specific mechanism
   for the above.  Also, is it the OCSP Responder's responsibility or
   the client's to check this?

   algorithm combinations we want to define.  EDNOTE: Merge with

   certificates will be used.  For example it will talk about the size
   of these certs and cert chains.  It will explain that if a cert in

   have to be of the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be
   transferred in the authentication exchange to save transport overhead
   and thus it can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.
   It will talk about overhead (size and processing).  It will also
   discuss backwards compatibility.  It could include a subsection about
   implementation considerations.

10.  Implications for existing standards

10.1.  RFC 2986

   EDNOTE: summarize the updates to RFC 2986 (CSR / PKCS#10).

10.2.  RFC 5280

   EDNOTE: summarize the updates to RFC 5280 (X.509).

10.3.  Cryptographic protocols

   EDNOTE: This section talks about how protocols like (D)TLS and IKEv2
   are affected by this specifications.  It will not attempt to solve
   all these problems, but it will explain the rationale, how things
   will work and what open problems need to be solved.  Obvious issues
   that need to be discussed:

   o  How does the protocol declare support for composite signatures?
      TLS has hooks for declaring support for specific signature
      algorithms, however it would need to be extended, because the
      client would need to declare support for both the composite
      infrastructure, as well as for the various component signature
      algorithms.

   o  How does the protocol use the multiple keys.  The obvious way
      would be to have the server sign using its composite public key;
      is this sufficient.

   o  Overhead; including certificate size, signature processing time,
      and size of the signature.

   o  How to deal with crypto protocols that use public key encryption
      algorithms; this document only lists how to work with signature
      algorithms.  Encoding composite public keys is straightforward;
      encoding composite ciphertexts is less so - we decided to put that
      off to another draft.

11.  IANA Considerations

   EDNOTE: This section will include content only if new OIDs or IANA
   codepoints are asigned for it.

   There are no IANA Considerations for this specification.  EDNOTE: ^^
   ?? Don't we need OIDs?

12.  Security Considerations

   EDNOTE: This section includes the Security Considerations.

   o  Case: Only one key is compromised.

   o  Case: An entire algorithm is compromised.

   o  CA implementations need to be careful when checking for
      compromised key reuse: unpack the CompositePublicKey structure and
      compare individual keys.

13.  Appendices

13.1.  Comparison with draft-truskovsky-lamps-pq-hybrid-x509

   EDNOTE: This section will explain the differences from
   [I-D.truskovsky-lamps-pq-hybrid-x509].  IPR Claims should be
   mentioned here if necessary.  Other things to consider are the things
   we discussed in an email thread like simplicity and format,
   inadvertnt implementation errors, algorithm agility.

14.  Contributors

   EDNOTE: This section includes the contributors of this draft so the
   authors in the first page do not exceed five and thus violate
   RFC2223-bis.  Example where this happens is RFC1122.  We can have
   another Editor for this draft.  Doesn't need to be Panos.

   This document incorporates contributions and comments from a large
   group of experts.  The Editor would especially like to acknowledge
   the tireless dedication of the following people, who attended many
   long meetings and generated millions of bytes of electronic mail over
   the past 3 years months in pursuit of this document: Mike Ounsworth
   (Entrust Datacard), John Gray (Entrust Datacard), Serge Mister
   (Entrust Datacard), Scott Fluhrer (Cisco Systems) and Panos
   Kampanakis (Cisco Systems).

   We are grateful to all, including any contributors who may have been
   inadvertently omitted from this list.

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, the deployment of
   cryptographic certificates using post-quantum algorithms will face
   two challenges

   o  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      also start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      certificate deployment that a public key algorithm has become
      untrustworthy, but in the interim, they may not know which
      algorithm an adversary has compromised.

   o  Backwards compatibility: During the transition period, post-
      quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.

   This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength
   uncertainty by providing formats for encoding multiple public keys
   into the existing public key field.  The issue of backwards
   compatibility is left open to be addressed in separate draft(s).

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document defines the following terms:

   EDNOTE: Look up the standard way to do glossaries in RFCs.

Internet-Draft               Composite Certs               December 2018


   EDNOTE: I think there's a proper way to reference another RFC or I-D.
   Look up.

   Traditional Certificate:

   An X.509 certificate conforming to RFC 5280.  In particular, a
   certificate containing a single subject public key, and a single
   issuer signature.

   Composite certificate:

   An X.509 certificate containing two or more subject public keys and
   two or more issuer signatures as defined in this document.

4.  Composite Certificates

   This section defines a certificate format containing multiple subject
   public keys and multiple issuer signatures.  This addresses the
   "algorithm strength uncertainty" concern from Section 2, though the
   authors note that this mechanism may have prove to have utility
   beyond the post-quantum migration.

   Algorithm strength uncertainty is addressed by defining new public
   key and signature data types that internally hold a list of public
   keys and signatures, respectively.  By adding this structure to the
   X.509 format, we avoid the exponential proliferation of OIDs needed
   for each pairwise combination of signature algorithms.  This scheme
   also naturally extends from 2-keypair to n-keypair should a vendor
   find a use for this.

4.1.  Composite Public Keys

   EDNOTE: This subsection describes the PKIX Composite Public Keys and
   how they work.

   We define the following new structures:

   CompositeAlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE OF AlgorithmIdentifier

   CompositePublicKey ::= SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING

   The choice of "SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING" rather than "BIT STRING" is so
   the type-length-value encoding can solve the problem of variable-
   length public keys.

   EDNOTE: I think there's a proper way to reference another RFC or I-D.
   Look up.

Internet-Draft               Composite Certs               December 2018


   We re-define the "SubjectPublicKeyInfo" structure from RFC 5280:

   SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  CHOICE {
        SEQUENCE  {
             algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,
             subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING  },
        SEQUENCE  {
             algorithms           CompositeAlgorithmIdentifier,
             subjectPublicKeys    CompositePublicKey }
         }

   The order MUST be consistent between the "algorithms" and the
   "subjectPublicKeys", ie the 0th "CompositeAlgorithmIdentifier" MUST
   correspond to the 0th "CompositePublicKey" and so on.

4.2.  Composite Signatures

   EDNOTE: This subsection describes the PKIX Composite Signatures and
   how they work.  It will also explain how signing a certificate will
   work and how verification will work.

   We define the following new structure:

   CompositeSignatureValue ::= SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING

   The choice of "SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING" rather than "BIT STRING" is so
   the type-length-value encoding can solve the problem of variable-
   length signature values.

   We re-define the "Certificate" structure from RFC 5280:

   Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
        tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,
        signatureAlgorithm   CHOICE {
             AlgorithmIdentifier,
             CompositeAlgorithmIdentifier }
        signatureValue       CHOICE {
             BIT STRING,
             CompositeSignatureValue }
       }

   If either the "signatureAlgorithm" or "signatureValue" field contains
   the composite version, then the other MUST as well.  The order MUST
   be consistent between the "signatureAlgorithm"s and the
   "signatureValue"s, ie the 0th "CompositeAlgorithmIdentifier" MUST
   correspond to the 0th "CompositeSignatureValue" and so on.

5.  Certificate Enrollment

5.1.  PCKS#10

   EDNOTE: This subsection talks about the new CSR attributes.  It will
   also talk about how requesting these certs will work.

   Once an entity in the PKI has a valid composite certificate, it MAY
   send subsequent certificate enrollment requests for traditional
   certificates containing a public key from the composite certificate
   using the same DN.  If the CA has previously issued one or more
   currently valid composite certificates for the same entity,
   containing that public key, and containing the same list of SANs,
   then it MUST include one "wtv_we_call_it" extension pointing to each
   such certificate, and MUST set the certificate expiry date to be not
   later than the expiry date of the referenced composite certificate
   with the {earliest expiry date?, latest expiry date?}.

6.  Certificate Revocation

   EDNOTE: This subsection will talk about compromises of keys,
   revocation and how recovation will be verified.

   When a CA checks for key reuse of compromised keys, they SHOULD
   (MUST?) check each key individually, not a bit-for-bit match of the
   entire "CompositePublicKey"

6.1.  Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)

   EDNOTE: A mention to OCSP implications should be made.

   EDNOTE: The mechanism for globally revoking an algorithm should be
   mentioned, along with the practical suggestion that an algorithm MAY
   be globally revoked on the composite PKI's CRL, but not on the
   traditional PKI.

6.2.  End-Entity Requested Revocation

   EDNOTE: Be explicit about whether a single-key revocation request has
   the authority to revoke the composite cert, and vice-versa.  EDNOTE:
   We may need to wade into modifications to the CMP / SCEP / EST
   protocols (but I really hope not).

7.  New Algorithm Identifiers

   EDNOTE: This subsection defines the OIDs for the initial composite
   algorithm combinations we want to define.

8.  In Practice

   EDNOTE: This section will talk about practical issue of how these
   certificates will be used.  For example it will talk about the size
   of these certs and cert chains.  It will explain that if a cert in
   the chain is a Composite cert then the whole chain needs to be of
   Composite Certs.  It will also explain that the root CA cert does not
   have to be of the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be
   transferred in the authentication exchange to save transport overhead
   and thus it can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.
   It will talk about overhead (size and processing).  It will also
   discuss backwards compatibility.  It could include a subsection about
   implementation considerations.

9.  Implications for existing standards

   EDNOTE: This section talks about how protocols like (D)TLS and IKEv2
   are affected by this specifications.  It will not attempt to solve
   all these problems, but it will explain the rationale, how things
   will work and what open problems need to be solved.  It will talk
   about implications of how to distinguish what cert chain to send.  It
   will describe how signature_algorithms extension will be used in TLS.
   What is missing in TLS and IKEv2 like what and how to sign something
   with the two private keys.  It will discuss overhead (size and
   processing) as in Section 8.  It will also discuss PKCS#10.

10.  IANA Considerations

   EDNOTE: This section will include content only if new OIDs or IANA
   codepoints are asigned for it.

   There are no IANA Considerations for this specification.  EDNOTE: ^^
   ??

   EDNOTE: We will need OIDs for these ASN.1 structures:

   o  CompositeAlgorithmIdentifier

   o  CompositePublicKey

   o  CompositeSignatureValue

11.  Security Considerations

   EDNOTE: This section includes the Security Considerations.

12.  Appendices

12.1.  Comparison with draft-truskovsky-lamps-pq-hybrid-x509

   EDNOTE: This section will explain the differences from
   [I-D.truskovsky-lamps-pq-hybrid-x509].  IPR Claims should be
   mentioned here if necessary.  Other things to consider are the things
   we discussed in an email thread like simplicity and format,
   inadvertnt implementation errors, algorithm agility.

   (MO): Move to appendix, or to a supporting document?

13.  Contributors

   EDNOTE: This section includes the contributors of this draft so the
   authors in the first page do not exceed five and thus violate
   RFC2223-bis.  Example where this happens is RFC1122.  We can have
   another Editor for this draft.  Doesn't need to be Panos.

   This document incorporates contributions and comments from a large
   group of experts.  The Editor would especially like to acknowledge
   the tireless dedication of the following people, who attended many
   long meetings and generated millions of bytes of electronic mail over
   the past 3 years months in pursuit of this document: Mike Ounsworth
   (Entrust Datacard), John Gray (Entrust Datacard), Serge Mister
   (Entrust Datacard), Scott Fluhrer (Cisco Systems) and Panos
   Kampanakis (Cisco Systems).

   We are grateful to all, including any contributors who may have been
   inadvertently omitted from this list.

--- abstract
With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different cryptographic algorithms. Since the trustworthiness of individual post-quantum algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic operation will need to be performed in such a way that breaking it requires breaking each of the component algorithms individually. This requires defining new structures for holding composite signature data. This document defines a structure generic enough to be useful beyond the post-quantum transition for any situation where a widely-supported but untrusted algorithm is being migrated to newer cryptography.

This document defines the structures CompositeSignatureValue, and CompositeParams, which are sequences of the respective structure for each component algorithm and allows for both explicitely-defined combinations of algorithms as well generic runtime-flexible signature algorithms. This document also defines processes for generating and verifying composite signatures. This document makes no assumptions about what the component algorithms are, provided that their algorithm identifiers and signature generation and verification processes are defined.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had sufficient scrutiny. Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm migrations, the choice of when to migrate and which algorithms to migrate to, is not so clear. Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to be composed of multiple public-key algorithms.

The deployment of composite signatures using post-quantum algorithms will face two challenges

- Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy, but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary has compromised.
- Backwards compatibility: During the transition period, post-quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.

This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength uncertainty by building on [draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys-00] (NOTE: need kramdown formatting help with this ref) by providing formats for encoding multiple signature values into existing public signature fields, as well as the process for validating a composite signature. Backwards compatibility is addressed via using composite in conjunction with a non-composite hybrid mode such as that described in [draft-becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth-00] (NOTE: need kramdown formatting help with this ref).

This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that digital signatures are used within PKIX and CMS structures.

# Composite Structures {#sec-composite-structs}

REMOVE THIS ENTIRE SECTION

In order for signatures to be composed of multiple algorithms, we define encodings consisting of a sequence of signature primitives (aka "component algorithms") such that these structures can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing signature fields such as those found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS [RFC5652].

This section defines the following structures:

  - The id-alg-composite is an AlgorithmIdentifier identifying a composite signature object.
    
    The sa-CompositeSignature AlgorithmIdentifier and the corresponding CompositeParams identify the algorithm(s) used in a composite signature.

  - The CompositeSignatureValue, carries a sequence of signatures that are generated by a CompositePrivateKey, and can be verified with the corresponding CompositePublicKey.

EDNOTE 2: the choice to define composite algorithm parameters as a sequence inside the existing fields avoids the exponential proliferation of OIDs that are needed for each combination of signature algorithms in other schemes for achieving multi-key certificates. This scheme also naturally extends from 2-keypair to n-keypair keys and certificates.

EDNOTE 2a: We have heard community feedback that the ASN.1 structures presented here are too flexible in that allow arbitrary combinations of an arbitrary number of signature algorithms. The feedback is that this is too much of a "footgun" for implementors and sysadmins. We are working on an alternative formulation using ASN.1 information object classes that allow for compiling explicit pairs of algorithmIDs. We would love community feedback on which approach is preferred. See slide 30 of this presentation: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2021-lamps-01/materials/slides-interim-2021-lamps-01-sessa-position-presentation-by-mike-ounsworth-00.pdf


## Composite Keys

A Composite signature MUST be associated with a Composite public key as defined in draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys-00] (NOTE: need kramdown formatting help with this ref).


### Key Usage Bits

For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along with the public key, then the composite public key associated with a composite signature MUST have a signing-type key usage.


If the keyUsage extension is present in a Certification Authority (CA) certificate that indicates id-composite-key, then any combination of the following values MAY be present:

~~~
digitalSignature;
nonRepudiation;
keyCertSign; and
cRLSign.
~~~

If the keyUsage extension is present in an End Entity (EE) certificate that indicates id-composite-key, then any combination of the following values MAY be present:

~~~
digitalSignature; and
nonRepudiation;
~~~


## Composite Signature {#sec-composite-sig-structs}

The ASN.1 algorithm object for a composite signature is:

~~~ asn.1
sa-CompositeSignature SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM ::= {
    IDENTIFIER identifier
    VALUE CompositeSignatureValue
    PARAMS ANY DEFINED BY ALGORITHM
    PUBLIC-KEYS { pk-Composite }
    SMIME-CAPS { IDENTIFIED BY id-alg-composite } }
}
~~~

The output of the composite signature algorithm is the DER encoding of the following structure:

~~~ asn.1
CompositeSignatureValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF BIT STRING
~~~
{: artwork-name="composite-sig-asn.1"}

Where each BIT STRING within the SEQUENCE is a signature value produced by one of the component keys. It MUST contain one signature value produced by each component algorithm, and in the same order as in the associated CompositeParams object.

The choice of `SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING`, rather than for example a single BIT STRING containing the concatenated signature values, is to gracefully handle variable-length signature values by taking advantage of ASN.1's built-in length fields.

## Encoding Rules {#sec-encoding-rules}
<!-- EDNOTE 7: Examples of how other specifications specify how a data structure is converted to a bit string can be found in RFC 2313, section 10.1.4, 3279 section 2.3.5, and RFC 4055, section 3.2. -->

Many protocol specifications will require that composite signature data structures be represented by an octet string or bit string.

When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite data structure SHALL be used directly.

When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string, with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

In the interests of simplicity and avoiding compatibility issues, implementations that parse these structures MAY accept both BER and DER.

# Algorithm Identifiers

## id-alg-composite

This algorithm is often referred to as "generic composite signatures". This algorithm allows for runtime agents to use arbitrary combinations of algorithms -- ie it does not need pre-defined OIDs for specific combinations.

The following object identifier is used for identifying a composite signature. This identifier MUST be used in sa-CompositeSignature.identifier.

~~~ asn.1
id-alg-composite OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
    iso(1)  identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4)
    enterprise(1) OpenCA(18227) Algorithms(2) id-alg-composite(1) }
~~~

EDNOTE: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping. We are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see {{sec-iana}}.


The following algorithm parameters MUST be included:

~~~ asn.1
CompositeParams ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF AlgorithmIdentifier
~~~
{: artwork-name="CompositeSignatureParams-asn.1-structures"}

The signature's CompositeParams sequence MUST contain the same component algorithms listed in the same order as in the associated CompositePrivateKey and CompositePublicKey.


## Other Explicit Algorithms

It is expected that other standards will define algorithms that specify which component algorithms are to be contained within them.

Explicit algorithms must define an OID to be used in sa-CompositeSignature.identifier.

For explicit algorithms, it is not necessary to carry the list of component algorithms in the signature algorithm params because clients can infer the expected component algorithms from the algorithm identifier.

# Composite Signature Processes {#sec-composite-signature-algorithm}

This section specifies the processes for generating and verifying composite signatures.

This process addresses algorithm strength uncertainty by providing the verifier with parallel signatures from all the component signature algorithms; thus breaking the composite signature would require breaking all of the component signatures.

## Composite Signature Generation Process {#sec-comp-sig-gen}

Generation of a composite signature involves applying each component algorithm's signature process to the input message according to its specification, and then placing each component signature value into the CompositeSignatureValue structure defined in {{sec-composite-sig-structs}}.

The following process is used to generate composite signature values.

~~~
Input:
     K1, K2, .., Kn     Private keys for the n component signature
                        algorithms, a CompositePrivateKey
     M                  Message to be signed, an octet string

Output:
     S                  The signatures, a CompositeSignatureValue

Signature Generation Process:
   1. Generate the n component signatures independently,
      according to their algorithm specifications.

        for i := 1 to n
            Si := Sign( Ki, M )

   2. Encode each component signature S1, S2, .., Sn into a BIT STRING
      according to its algorithm specification.

        S ::= Sequence { S1, S2, .., Sn }

   3. Output S
~~~
{: artwork-name="alg-composite-sig-gen"}


Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed in ~~ Reference draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-pubkeys sec-composite-pub-keys ~~, no component signature may itself be a composite; ie the signature generation process MUST fail if one of the private keys K1, K2, .., Kn is a composite with the OID id-alg-composite.

A composite signature MUST produce, and include in the output, a signature value for every component key in the corresponding CompositePrivateKey.


## Composite Signature Verification Process {#sec-comp-sig-verify}

Verification of a composite signature involves applying each component algorithm's verification process according to its specification.

In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise, compliant applications MUST output "Valid signature" (true) if and only if all component signatures were successfully validated, and "Invalid signature" (false) otherwise.

The following process is used to perform this verification.



~~~
Input:
     P    Signer's composite public key
     M    Message whose signature is to be verified, an octet string
     S    Composite Signature to be verified
     A    Composite Algorithm identifier

Output:
    Validity      "Valid signature" (true) if the composite signature
                  is valid, "Invalid signature" (false) otherwise.

Signature Verification Procedure::
   1. Parse P, S, A into the component public keys, signatures,
      and algorithm identifiers

      P1, P2, .., Pn := Desequence( P )
      S1, S2, .., Sn := Desequence( S )
      A1, A2, .., An := Desequence( A )

    If Error during Desequencing, or the three sequences have
    different numbers of elements, or any of the public keys P1, P2, .., Pn or
    algorithm identifiers A1, A2, .., An are composite with the OID
    id-alg-composite then output "Invalid signature" and stop.

   2. Check each component signature individually, according to its
       algorithm specification.
       If any fail, then the entire signature validation fails.

     for i := 1 to n
          if not verify( Pi, M, Si ), then
            output "Invalid signature"

      if all succeeded, then
        output "Valid signature"
~~~
{: artwork-name="alg-sig-verif"}

Since recursive composite public keys are disallowed in ~~ Reference draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys sec-composite-pub-keys ~~, no component signature may be composite; ie the signature verification procedure MUST fail if any of the public keys P1, P2, .., Pn or algorithm identifiers A1, A2, .., An are composite with the OID id-alg-composite.

Some verification clients may include a policy mechanism for specifying acceptable subsets of alorithms. In these cases, implementors MAY, in the interest of performance, modify the above proess to skip one or more signature validations as per their local client policy. See {{sec-cons-OR-modes}} for a discussion of associated risks.

In the absence of such a policy machanism that can be easily updated to reflect new cryptanalytic breakthroughs, clients MUST perform signature verifications in the AND mode defined here.

# In Practice {#sec-in-pract}

This section addresses practical issues of how this draft affects other protocols and standards.


~~~ BEGIN EDNOTE 10~~~

EDNOTE 10: Possible topics to address:

  - The size of these certs and cert chains.
  - In particular, implications for (large) composite keys / signatures / certs on the handshake stages of TLS and IKEv2.
  - If a cert in the chain is a composite cert then does the whole chain need to be of composite Certs?
  - We could also explain that the root CA cert does not have to be of the same algorithms. The root cert SHOULD NOT be transferred in the authentication exchange to save transport overhead and thus it can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.
  - We could talk about overhead (size and processing).
  - We could also discuss backwards compatibility.
  - We could include a subsection about implementation considerations.

~~~ END EDNOTE 10~~~



## Cryptographic protocols

This section talks about how protocols like (D)TLS and IKEv2 are affected by this specifications. It will not attempt to solve all these problems, but it will explain the rationale, how things will work and what open problems need to be solved. Obvious issues that need to be discussed.

- How does the protocol declare support for composite signatures?  TLS has hooks for declaring support for specific signature algorithms, however it would need to be extended, because the client would need to declare support for both the composite infrastructure, as well as for the various component signature algorithms.

- How does the protocol use the multiple keys.  The obvious way would be to have the server sign using its composite public key; is this sufficient.

- Overhead; including certificate size, signature processing time, and size of the signature.

- How to deal with crypto protocols that use public key encryption algorithms; this document only lists how to work with signature algorithms.  Encoding composite public keys is straightforward; encoding composite ciphertexts is less so - we decided to put that off to another draft.


<!-- End of In Practice section -->

# IANA Considerations {#sec-iana}
The ASN.1 module OID is TBD.  The id-alg-composite OID is to be assigned by IANA.  The authors suggest that IANA assign an OID on the id-pkix arc:

~~~
id-alg-composite OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
    iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
    mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6) composite(??) }
~~~

<!-- End of IANA Considerations section -->


# Security Considerations

## Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a single cryptographic algorithm. If and when an algorithm becomes deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), it is obvious that structures using that algorithm are implicitly revoked.

In the composite model this is less obvious since a single public key, certificate, or signature may contain a mixture of deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms. Moreover, implementers may decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary security properties and are acceptable in combination even though neither algorithm is acceptable by itself.

Specifying a modified verification algorithm to handle these situations is beyond the scope of this draft, but could be desirable as the subject of an application profile document, or to be up to the discretion of implementers.

~~~
2. Check policy to see whether A1, A2, ..., An constitutes a valid
   combination of algorithms.

   if not checkPolicy(A1, A2, ..., An), then
     output "Invalid signature"
~~~

While intentionally not specified in this document, implementors should put careful thought into implementing a meaningfull policy mechinism within the context of their signature verification engines, for example only algorithms that provide similar security levels should be combined together.

## OR Modes {#sec-cons-OR-modes}

As defined in this document, signers MUST produce a signature value with each of their component private keys, this providing full protection of the content under all available component algorithms. 

This document defines a composite signature verification process {{sec-comp-sig-verify}} where the verifier verifies all component signatures and fails if any component fails. The authors recognize that there will be scenarios where the verifier considers a single component algorithm -- or subset of component algorithms -- to provide sufficient security, and therefore for performance reasons wishes to skip the verification of one or more component signatures.

-- harmonize this with Serge's blurb --



Risks:

- Failing to update client verification policy in response to advances in cryptanalysis
- Verifications of a subset of signatures leads to ambiguity in the security strength of the signature verification; ie if a message carries two signatures, one at 128 bits and the other at 112 bits of security and clients are verifying in an OR mode with flexible policy, then it becomes difficult to audit the security strength used at runtime.
- Moreover, verifying multiple algorithms provides security even in the event that one of the algorithms has already been broken, but knowledge of the break has not been made public yet.
